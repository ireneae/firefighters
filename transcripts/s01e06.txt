* Fly me to the moon * Let me play * Among the stars * Let me see what...
MAN: Hey, look.
WOMAN: Oh, wow.
I feel like I'm dreaming.
MAN: I told you you'd love it.
WOMAN : I had to work up the courage.
You've had your pilot's license for all of a month.
Had no faith.
* Baby, kiss me...
MAN: Now, look.
Wow.
It's amazing.
Now, look, Kate, Griffith Park Observatory.
KATE: Our first date.
MAN: Best day of my life.
I'm gonna swing us back around, okay?
Okay.
* All I worship and adore...
Crap.
Aah, aah!
This is not good.
KATE: What's not What's happening?
MAN: Uh, th-there's a binder under your seat.
Grab it. Last page is a checklist.
Um, uh, okay.
Uh...
Now, last one.
Okay. Okay, here.
"Emergency landing without engine power"?
Read the list, babe.
Um, "Airspeed 65 knots." Check.
KATE: "Mixture idle cutoff." MAN: Check.
"Verify flight ring is engaged." Check.
KATE: "Initiate engagement process." Check.
"Confirm pilot is head over heels in love with the passenger."
MAN: Check.
KATE: "Will the pilot promise "to love and cherish the passenger until his dying day?"
MAN: Double check.
I love you so much, Kate.
I hate you.
MAN: What do you say? Do you like it?
Will you be my copilot?
Kate.
Hey, Kate. Kate?
Aah!
Kate! Kate! Kate!
911, what's your emergency?
My girlfriend passed out! I think she had a heart attack.
Is she breathing normally, sir? Can you feel a pulse?
Yeah, yeah I can feel her breathing. But her heart is racing like crazy.
What is your location, sir? An ambulance will be on the way.
No, it won't! I'm in a Cessna flying over Los Angeles.
Oh, okay.
Tell me what happened up there, sir.
Was she complaining of chest pain or nausea?
No, no, nothing. She just passed out.
Is she on any medications?
Uh, yeah, uh, some kind of thyroid medication, but nothing serious.
I can't believe I did this. I think I did this.
Did what, sir?
I-I pretended there was something wrong with the plane.
Why would you do that?
I had a proposal written out on the emergency instructions.
I was gonna propose on Valentine's Day Okay.
Um...and I don't want to be so on the nose, so I thought I'd do it a few days early.
Okay, okay, listen to me.
You have to get her on the ground.
Have you notified Air Traffic Control?
Yeah, yeah, they said I could touch down at Burbank Airport in 15 minutes.
Is there any place closer where you could make an emergency landing?
Get off. Get off.
Brakes, brakes, brakes.
All right, let's put her over here.
Okay.
Does she have any history of heart problems?
MAN: No, she's only 32.
How does this happen?
Blood pressure's 80/40.
Still dropping.
Hen, looks like a possible heart attack.
Nitro sublingual.
Hey, Abbs, I'm-I'm on a call.
ABBY: Okay, but don't hang up.
I'm the one who took the call you're on.
Listen, after he told me about the stunt that he pulled and he told me about her condition, I called her doctor.
Wait, wh --
ABBY: Oh, he didn't tell you?
Romeo faked an air emergency.
You faked an emergency?
I was proposing.
I thought I was being romantic.
ABBY: The doctor says she's on levothyroxine for her thyroid condition, which you know can 'cause heart palpitations.
Guys, she's on levothyroxine.
Not a heart attack.
Broken heart syndrome?
That's what I'm thinking.
Okay.
I'll get the adenosine.
Mimics the symptoms of a heart attack.
It was probably brought on by her thyroid medication and you nearly scaring her half to death.
HEN: You don't treat it the same as a cardiac event.
That nitro we almost gave her could've caused some real damage.
All right, she's coming to. She's coming to.
That's it. Take some deep breaths.
Good call, Abby. She's, uh, she's conscious.
She's conscious, she's conscious.
You're okay.
BOBBY: You're okay.
Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Oh, baby, thank God.
BOBBY: All right, you think you can sit up?
Here, take it slowly.
KATE : Can I see the ring again?
Wait, what's happening?
I think she's actually considering his proposal.
Yes.
She said yes.
And she smacked him.
Love hurts.
Good. All right.
Now, three tablespoons of sugar.
The tablespoons are the bigger ones, Mom.
I know.
Let her remember.
Remember? Mom.
Honestly? I think this is the first time I've ever seen you bake anything.
Oh.
I mean, Dad always did the cooking.
Well, I made plenty of reservations.
And now you're making Valentine's cookies.
I love Valentine's Day.
It's, like, the one day of the year we can be sappy and romantic and in love with love.
So, then, why are you dating a guy who only likes to bone on the phone?
We're not dating, Carla.
Although he did invite me to the party at the firehouse.
I don't know. It's getting kind of irritating.
I mean, I'm fine with him being a boy toy.
You know, I'm all right with that.
But he's so afraid he's gonna do something wrong or hurt me or something.
Frankly, I just want to put on some fancy underwear, and...
...get my hair done, and go out, and have a nice time and feel special.
Amen to that.
Well, maybe if Buck doesn't pull through, we'll all do a girls' night.
Ooh.
CARLA: No. No way.
A woman like you, smart and sexy with hair like an angel deserves a real Valentine's Day.
If he doesn't want to give it to you, honey, then...sayonara, fireboy.
Oh, yes.
Okay.
God, I hate Valentine's Day.
Everywhere you look, it's perfume ads, candy ads, jewelry ads. It is a fake holiday designed by women to make guys feel guilty and go into debt.
You think it's just women who run the companies that are trying to sell you those things?
BUCK: Well, they're at least in on it.
Well, I know plenty of women...
who don't like Valentine's Day and plenty of guys who love it.
You?
Yeah.
Here and there, I've been known since I was about eight years old to like Valentine's Day.
And after I met my wife, I'll tell you what...
you have someone to share it with, it could be pretty great.
You must miss her a lot on Valentine's Day.
Miss her every day, Buck.
Miss her every day.
* Here comes Johnny Yen again * With the liquor and drugs...
Welcome back, Chim.
Aw, you guys.
BUCK: How does it feel to be back?
Uh, beats the alternative.
Seriously, though, everybody, uh, one thing I realized while I was gone is that, uh, I really need you people like I need a hole in the head!
Oh! I cannot.
Place hasn't been the same without you, Chim.
You're the heart of this firehouse.
I'm glad to have you back.
Thanks, Bobby.
ATHENA: Hey, you had a lot of people praying for you, not just this department, either.
Well, I think somebody was listening.
Even the doctors kept using the word "miracle." I guess if you're gonna have a piece of rebar that's sticking through your skull, that's the way to do it.
Just you, Buck.
Oh. Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade.
Oh, that's not funny.
Shade, shade.
BOBBY: All right. Let's light you up so you can make a wish.
All right.
All right, who's got a match?
Really?
Firehouse and nobody's got a match?
Hi.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Yeah, uh, I'm here for the party.
Oh, you're a friend of Chimney's. Come on.
No, I'm not a friend. I mean, I feel like I know Chimney, but...'cause I feel like I...
You're...are you Captain Nash?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Abby Clark, a friend of Buck's.
Oh, you're the woman from the phone.
Yes...
911 operator.
Right. Yes, yes, yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
BUCK: Hey, Abby.
Hi.
You showed. That's so cool.
Hi.
How are you doing? It's good to see you.
Hi.
Hey.
BUCK: And you brought cookies.
ABBY: I brought cookies.
Come on up.
Uh, so, everyone, um, this is Abby Clark.
She is L. A.'s fiercest 911 operator and she brought cookies, so...
Ah, there you go.
Come on in.
This is, uh, this is Chimney.
The-the guy...
CHIMNEY: Hi.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
This is Ab-Abby.
Oh, I'm good.
I can barely feel it now.
ABBY: Oh, great.
Uh, would you like some cake?
No, I'm good. Thank you.
Okay.
Uh, okay, come on, come on. There's...
It's nice to meet you.
You, too.
I was gonna light the candle.
I get dumped after surviving rebar through my skull and he ends up with her?
What's that kid have that I don't?
Forget I asked.
Yes.
All right.
I want a lot of ice cream.
ABBY: Oh, God.
Yeah, it's...
that's one thing to say about it.
It's cool.
Hey.
Yeah.
Nice to see you.
You, too.
Oh, you know what, she's doing fine. Thank you.
Thanks for asking.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Hen.
Hi, Hen, I'm Abby.
I work with your boy here.
Glad to know you really exist.
Mm.
ABBY: Thanks.
He talks about you all the time.
Really?
Little. Little bit.
So, where's he taking you?
Valentine's Day tomorrow.
Oh, we, uh...
We hadn't really, uh...
Don't. We don't have a plan.
Yeah, I mean, you know, I-I have to work, and...
Your shift ends at 2:00. So does mine.
I'm going home to my wife.
Uh, well, we're just being casual.
It's no big deal.
It's just...It's just a day.
Yeah, the only day he's obligated to show you a good time.
So, what are you doing for Valentine's Day?
Me?
Hell, I put in for a extra shift.
I'm doing whatever I can to get my mind off romance for the night.
Oh.
So, where you taking her?
And it better not be a salad bar.
Whoa.
No, you know, it'll be someplace, uh, really nice.
Okay.
Great. Yeah.
Cool.
Getting kinda late for a rezzy.
Well, I know people.
HEN: Oh.
He knows people.
He knows people.
Oh, yeah.
Good-bye, Hen. Good-bye, Hen.
Ah...
Um, we gotta go.
Um, tomorrow. How about 7:00?
Okay. All right.
All right, see ya.
Thanks. Go.
Did you not like it?
It's good, it's just a little salty for my taste.
Oh. Well, I have a lot of snacks for our Valentine's Day double feature: The Notebook and Fatal Attraction.
I'm kidding. I hate The Notebook.
Uh, we can have sex during intermission.
You told me you didn't want to make a V-Day plan, so that means we get to do mine instead.
Now is the moment in my schedule where you give me my gift.
Oh, right.
You mentioned, once, liking that brand, so...
I like chocolate.
I like Le Vian diamonds.
Real diamonds, not Le Vian diamond-shaped chocolates.
Did you think I was going to get you real diamonds?
Ted, I had a plan.
A really specific plan for tonight, and you're messing it up.
You gave me a $14.00 box of chocolates for Valentine's Day.
I spent all day cooking for you and getting waxed and buying sexy underwear -- I spent hours on tonight.
Maybe you should have spent a few less hours salting the food.
Okay, that's it, I'm out.
You know, my friends told me to stay away from you.
Said you had the crazy eyes.
You told me you loved me.
I tell that to everyone.
Okay, you want me to do this the hard way? Fine.
You're not my only girlfriend.
Okay? I-I can't watch a movie with you because I've got plans with another girl later tonight.
Got her the same box of chocolates.
You don't mean anything to me, Melora.
Okay, get out of the way, Melora.
911, what's your emergency?
Yeah, something's happening at my neighbor's place.
I'd knock, but I don't want to get involved. Can you send someone?
ATHENA: LAPD. Open up, please.
You all right, ma'am?
Yes, I'm fine.
We got a noise complaint from one of your neighbors.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I got into a fight with my boyfriend.
It probably got loud.
Is he still here?
No, I'm all alone.
Mind if I come in?
I'll just have a look around?
Sure.
MELORA: Dumped on Valentine's Day.
Can you believe it?
Yeah, well, men can be dogs.
I just thought he was a good dog.
Thought he would be the one.
Yeah, well, sometimes the one isn't even the one.
Take it from me, you can be married and still feel alone.
Sometimes, yeah.
We all do.
But you're wearing that ring.
Yeah, well, I took a vow.
That's so beautiful.
Listen.
Any man who can do this to you on Valentine's Day, he ain't worth it.
All right? You're better off without him -- you hear me?
That's from a long time ago.
That was really just a cry for help.
I'll tell you what.
You've been through a lot tonight.
If the blues come back and you feel like crying out for help, you make a call and talk to me.
This is my card.
I'll be on duty all night.
You've got a good heart.
DISPATCHER: Available units.
Available units, 211 in progress, corner of Beverly and Vermont.
727-L-30. Show me en route.
You okay?
I will be now. Thank you.
I just got some excellent advice from a very wise woman.
You sure you don't want me to stay?
I feel bad, you and Chimney having to pull double shifts.
Aw, Chimney's so excited to be back, he'd work four shifts in a row if we asked him to.
I already told Gardner I'd cover the first half of his day so he could spend it with his wife.
So I'm good. All right, turn around.
What if I screw this up?
Screw it up?
Well, my advice is don't.
Uh, okay, what happens if we start having sex?
Why would that happen?
'Cause that's what always happens -- I'm a sex addict.
Self-diagnosed, yeah.
Listen, it's not uncommon for a guy to use quick, meaningless sex to avoid real intimacy.
So you're saying, you know, it might be okay to sleep with her, just as long as I'm not a dick about it?
I didn't say that.
Is that what you think I said?
That's what I heard.
That's not what I said.
Why don't you try this?
Why don't you try something new?
Why don't you try, just once, getting to know her? Really get to know her.
Okay...
CARLA: Wow.
It just jumped ten degrees in here.
You don't look like a whore at all.
Thanks, Mom.
Well...I'm excited.
And with any luck, nobody'll get hurt.
Okay, look, I need you to stop worrying about everybody else's wants and feelings, and start worrying about your own, okay?
Fine. I'm just...I'm excited.
It's Valentine's Day and I'm going out.
Okay, so I should...not sleep with her tonight.
Correct.
Okay.
You should not have sex with her tonight if you're really interested in her.
A woman like that deserves a little chivalry.
Chivalry? Okay, I like that.
You know, and...don't be a dick.
You know what, Buck, I think if you focus on the first part, the second part'll take care of itself.
Geez.
I got it, I got it. Let me try on this jacket.
You look real handsome.
Yeah.
Okay. Good.
Good luck.
I don't want it.
Good luck keeping it in your pants.
No, I'm not...Bobby!
911, what's your emergency?
There's this, like, totally insane crash on the 710! I'm 100% fine, but there's like a million cars piled up everywhere.
Ugh! I'm totally gonna be late to the V-Day dance.
I need you to back up, sir.
So, what's the situation here?
12 cars, no fatalities.
But we got a medical transport vehicle sandwiched in there.
Driver's freaking out. Says they were delivering an organ for transplant.
Please, this organ has to get to Southland Medical immediately.
The patient is critical. She's prepped and waiting.
I got this.
Buckle up, buttercup.
MED TECH: Uh, what...
what...okay. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa!
Oh, g...
ATHENA: Hang on.
* There goes my heart...
MED TECH: I don't think we're gonna make it.
ATHENA: Oh, we're gonna make it.
* There goes the one I love This is unit 727-L-30.
I need a manual traffic control at the 10 freeway onramp eastbound at Alameda.

MED TECH: Red light. Red -- Red light. Red light! Ah! Whoa, God!
* There goes somebody else
The transplant recipient. Whose life are we saving?
MED TECH: Her name is Anna Cerritos.
She's a 16-year-old high school student from Seattle.
Her whole family's flown out here to be with her.
All right, we got you, Anna.
* It couldn't last somehow
MED TECH: Whoa, big truck.
White truck. Truck truck!
* I never thought...
No, any...! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Look out!
* There goes my heart...
ATHENA: Here we are.
Thank God.
* And here * Am I.
Thank you, Officer. You may have saved a life tonight.
ATHENA: Well, I can't think of anything better than delivering a heart on Valentine's Day.
That was a kidney.
Kidneys are good.
727-L-30, this is Dispatch. Come in.
Go for 727-L-30.
DISPATCHER: Sergeant Grant, police welfare check requested at 844 Sanborn, Los Angeles.
Show 727-L-30 responding.
Sergeant Athena, you came.
Uh...I was under the impression that, uh, you were having distress?
I was having a moment.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Did you know See's Candies is open 24/7?
I just...I wanted to thank you for your kind words earlier.
Oh...
I ate all the caramel ones.
Uh, wh -- wait, you know, this is, this is very sweet of you, but, um...
You really didn't have to do this.
I just...You were so kind to me, and I was thinking, we're both members of The Lonely Hearts Club.
Um...
To The Lonely Hearts Club!
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, here, let me just, um...
No. Oh, no, no.
No, no, no, no. It's fine. It's fine.
I-I appreciate the thought.
Um, may I use your restroom and then go?
Of course. You're working. I'm sorry.
It's just down the hall to the left.
MELORA: There's hydrogen peroxide under the sink if you need it.
Thank you. I'm fine.
If that doesn't work, there's ammonia under there, too.
That works really well on blood.
Melora.
I'm gonna need to get, uh, your ex-boyfriend's phone number for my report.
Melora?
Wish you hadn't gone in there.
The superglue's still drying. It isn't ready yet.
Think this'll work?
I'd actually recommend this one, sir.
Okay.
Full-bodied red. Pair nicely with both of your meals.
Fantastic. That's what we'll go with.
ABBY: He's so cute.
Thank you.
Oh, God, I wonder if he'll ask to see his ID.
What if he asks to see his and not mine?
Ahh.
Hey.
You weren't kidding. You really do know people.
I don't know how you got us in here.
I, uh, I know the owner. Well, I-I met him, um...
We, uh...we contained a noxious gas leak for them a couple weeks ago, so...
Oh...
Yeah, just try not to breathe much.
Yeah, do that.
Uh...
Um, uh, no.
It's fine. Uh, he was really appreciative.
Thank you very much.
Uh, yeah, sure. Tastes like wine to me.
Thank you.
Oh, no thanks.
Oh, please. Go ahead.
BUCK: Man, she's pretty.
Her hair's amazing.
Look like that before?
Buck, stop.
Remember, you're not sleeping with her.
ABBY: I think I can see his muscles through that jacket.
Cheers. Thank you.
And happy Valentine's Day.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Mm.
Be cool. I'm not choking in front of her.
Yeah.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Wait, don't drink, 'cause you could...
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, God. Wait, don't drink.
Do you know the Heimlich maneuver?
I do. Get him up.
Okay.
Get him up.
He's not breathing.
911, what's your emergency?
I'm at Le Chance Bistro in Century City. I need paramedics dispatched. Adult male, 26, fully blocked airway.
He stopped breathing about 30 seconds ago. I've started compressions.
Come on, Buck.
Call 911.
We already did.
Call 'em again. Put 'em on speaker.
OPERATOR: 911. What's your emergency?
It's emergency dispatcher Abby Clark, Parker Center.
I'm not on site.
I need to speak to Stephanie Gaskins in Emergency Medical Dispatch.
STEPHANIE: This is EMD Gaskins.
Steph, it's Abby.
ABBY: I've got an adult male, fully obstructed air pipe.
Yes, but he's unconscious.
I can't remove the object.
He stopped breathing two minutes ago.
Another three minutes, and he's gonna have brain damage.
I need you to walk me through an emergency tracheotomy.
Abby, have you lost your mind?
Come on.
You know the paramedics are gonna be at least seven minutes.
I can't let this happen.
I've got to do something.
You got a knife? Something sharp?
And you're going to need something to keep the airway open, like a pen or a straw.
A knife a-and a pen or a straw, something.
Okay.
WAITER: Here.
Thanks.
Find the indentation between his Adam's apple and the cricoid cartilage.
Okay.
Yup. Okay, I think I found it.
STEPHANIE: You're going to make a horizontal incision, a half-inch wide and about half-inch deep.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Okay.
STEPHANIE: There shouldn't be a lot of blood, but try to keep it from leaking into his windpipe.
Okay, I did it.
STEPHANIE: Okay, stick your finger in, open it up.
Oh, God. Oh, my God. Okay, okay, okay.
Get the pen in there.
Two quick breaths.
Five seconds. Four...
Three...Two. Another quick breath.
PARAMEDIC: Excuse me, excuse me. Gurney coming through.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
PARAMEDIC: Gurney coming through.
You're okay.
911, what's your emergency?
I, uh. I can't move. I think I broke my back.
Sir, you are going to have to speak up. Did you say you think you broke your back?
Yes. Yes, I fell.
Can you speak up please? It sounds like you're whispering.
Just please come to 617 Marshall Drive in Van Nuys.
CHIMNEY: Was the caller the only one in the house?
BOBBY: As far as I know, but if not, he could be laid up.
You might have to bust the door open.
Check in there, too.
LAFD, anybody home?
Los Angeles Fire Department, anybody home?
All right, Chim, go ahead.
All right.
Bust it open.
CHRISTINA: Um...
Hi. Can I help you?
Uh, yes, a man called 911, gave us this address.
Said he had fallen, he was in some kind of distress.
Male in distress?
No. I'm the only man here, and pretty sure I'm not in distress.
And the two of you have been home all night?
I-I was. Alex...
I told her I had to work on Valentine's Day.
You should have seen how pissed off she was at me.
But it was all part of the plan.
He came home and surprised me with flowers and takeout from Mr. Chows.
Yeah, her favorite.
I'm a serious romantic.
So you weren't expecting him home until later?
Not for hours.
Uh, would you guys mind if we took a quick peek around the perimeter?
It's procedure.
Yeah, yeah. Of course. You want me to show you around?
No. We've got it. You can get back to your romance.
Yes.
Got it?
Watch your step, there, Captain.
Watch your step.
See anything, Chim?
Nothing over here.
Hey, Chim.
Over here.
Oh. Shh.
Come here.
Don't move. Do not move, sir.
You jumped from up there, didn't you?
Yeah. Yes.
Okay.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Uh, two.
Uh, Valentine's Day.
They broken?
Ow.
Ah...
There's deformity. They're both broken.
BOBBY: Sir, I'm just gonna stabilize your neck.
There.
Ah.
So you sustained what we call a Casanova Fracture.
What, uh, w-why is it called a Casanova Fracture?
Well, woman is having an affair, husband comes home early, the guy jumps off: Casanova.
Oh, God.
Y-ow, ow, ow!
Sir, take it easy, we're gonna roll you over.
Careful. No.
On the count of three.
No. No!
One, two, three.
No. No.
Oh, God! Oh...
CHIMNEY: You're okay. You're all right.
You're okay. Yeah, okay.
MICKEY: Oh, God, my leg. Ow!
What the...oh, God.
What the hell is going...?
Was he in here when I got home?
You said you were gonna be at work.
Oh.
BOBBY: All right, take a breath. This man has been severely injured, and you can work this all out with your wife once we get him medical attention and get him out of here.
She's not my wife.
She's my wife.
We're separated.
You said it was done between the two of you.
You asked me to move in here.
I'm sorry. I-I really am.
There's just so much history between us.
So many memories.
Oh, God!
CHRISTINA: Baby.
MICKEY: What?
I am so sorry.
Are you okay?
Uh, I'm okay.
I'm okay. I love you.
I love...I love you.
I love you!
CHRISTINA: Wait.
Wait, can I ride with him?
BOBBY: Yeah, so long as the divorce papers aren't signed yet.
So was that creepy or romantic?
Eh, a little of both.
Got to love Valentine's Day.
This...
This was supposed to be a surprise.
Ted didn't seem to appreciate the effort I put into Valentine's Day, but...
he will once I'm done with him.
Once you're done with him?
Melora, you chopped him up and superglued him back together.
Well, yeah. How would you have done it?
Melora, stop it. Look at me.
Look at me.
You're sick.
And it's not your fault.
You're on so many drugs, you don't know what you're doing.
No, that's not true.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
And actually, you know what?
I'm so sick of people telling me what's wrong with me.
There's nothing wrong with my brain.
It's my heart. I have a broken heart.
Melora, you're suffering, and you've been hurt.
And I can relate.
You have to believe me when I tell you that heartbreak doesn't last forever.
But some mistakes do.
Now whatever happens after tonight, the system can-can go easy on a woman scorned, but not on one who hurts a cop.
So untie me. I can help you, but you have to untie me.
WOMAN: Somebody help me, please!
Help me!
Well, look who finally woke up.
Who else is here, Melora?
Ashleigh.
The girl Ted was gonna spend Valentine's Day with.
He met her at the gym because could he be more of a cliché?
I saw it in their texts.
And then I texted her from his phone and told her to come here for a romantic rendezvous...
I bashed her over the head when she came, with a pan, a couple times, but not enough, apparently, 'cause she hasn't lost the ability to speak.
She's not a good person. She's not like us.
ASHLEIGH: Please help me!
Or maybe she's a victim, too.
Maybe Ted duped her, just like he did you.
No.
Maybe he didn't tell her that he already had a girlfriend.
No, she knew.
They probably had a good laugh about me!
Help, please!
Well, maybe you should bring her up here so we can find out.
We could talk to her together.
You think I should kill her up here?
No, you shouldn't hurt that girl.
She has to die tonight, because what if she tries to get Ted back?
Sweetheart, Ted's dead.
He won't be once I fix him, okay?
Ted was perfect. He had a job, he was handsome, the sex was great.
Only problem was that he had an awful, cheating heart.
He just needs a new heart, a good one.
ASHLEIGH: Help!
It doesn't work that way.
Course it does.
You're a really good person, Athena.
You honored your vows.
You were so nice to me.
That's why I had you come back here tonight because your heart is so wonderful and pure.
And if I can take your heart and put it in Ted, then all of my dreams come true.
MELORA: This says I need a handsaw to get through your rib cage. I mean, who the heck has a handsaw just lying around?
Whatever, I'll make it work.
That's what Melora does.
Makes the best out of things.
Creating art from garbage.
Get your hands off of me.
How am I supposed to cut your heart out if I can't touch you?
Do you know the real history of Valentine's Day?
It started in Roman times as a pagan ritual to Lupercalia.
I know this because my daughter did a report on it for school.
The men of the towns would strip naked and run down the streets, beating unmarried women or infertile women, because they thought the beatings would somehow cure them.
Or help find them a husband.
Then, they sacrificed a dog...
That's not true.
It's to celebrate Saint Valentine, the patron saint of love.
ATHENA: Saint Valentine? Ha!
The patron saint of epileptics, not lovers.
You're a liar.
And you are a crazy bitch.
Better than a dead one!
SANDRA: Let me in!
I know you're in there, you piece of garbage!
Hey, stop it.
Where is he?
Ted! Ted!
Miss! Miss, hey!
Hey, who are you?
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Miss!
Okay, what kind of weird, kinky crap does he have You need to calm down.
Now, who are you?
I'm Sandra.
Ted made a Valentine's date with me tonight, and then, he just stood me up.
Ted! You bastard, I know you're here, you cheater!
I used Find My Phone to see where you were!
You signed into your iCloud on my computer like a damn idiot!
I can track you wherever you are in this city.
Where is he? I'm gonna kill him.
No, little late for that, honey.
Ted already gave his heart to someone else.
You were his third date of the evening.
None of which he's gonna make because he's dead.
727-L-30 requesting R. A. units, homicide detectives and backup at my location for a crime scene.
Tell them to send a straitjacket and a horse tranquilizer.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Thanks to you.
Happy Valentine's Day.
: Help me, she's crazy.
It's okay, it's okay. Everything's all right now.
All right, let's get you out of here.
Who is she?
She?
She's his second date.
You girls need to do better at picking men.
ANDERSON: Chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol.
These are first-generation antipsychotics.
ATHENA: Poor girl.
All she wanted was to be loved.
We'll take it from here, Sergeant.
Go home and see your husband.
It's Valentine's Day for a few more hours.
Hi.
BOBBY: Hi.
How's he doing?
Mm. Still out of it.
Well, from what I understand, he'd be completely out it if it hadn't been for you.
Ah. Well...
You saved his life.
The surgeon told me you did a pretty impressive job, too.
I'm just mostly trying not to think about it, really.
Listen, you've had a pretty traumatic night.
If you don't want to sit here with him, you don't have to.
I can do that.
No, no, no. I-I do, I want to.
I-I'd love the company, though, if you want to...
Well, some Valentine's Day, huh?
Super romantic.
Well, it's one he'll never forget.
No. It was all going so great, until I had to cut a hole in his throat.
Valentine's Day rarely works out the way you expect it to.
You know, that's life. You got to roll with what comes.
Don't know what's around the corner.
Spoken like a true first responder.
No, it's straight out of the handbook.
Yeah. Yes.
Yeah, I remember.
Seem like you could use a cup of coffee.
That's okay, right? I mean, you can't choke on that, can you?
Well, clearly you've never had the coffee from here before.
I'll risk it.
All right.
* One night to be confused * One night to speed up truth * We had a promise made * Four hands and then away
* Both under influence * We had divine sense * To know what to say * Mind is a razor blade
* To call for hands of above * To lean on * Wouldn't be good enough * For me, no
* One night of magic rush * The start: a simple touch * One night to push and scream * And then relief
* Ten days of perfect tunes * The colors red and blue * We had a promise made, we were in love.
