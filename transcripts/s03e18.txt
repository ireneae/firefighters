Isn't Chris kind of young for that?

I'm pretty sure I brought in the brochure so you guys can make me feel better about him going.

Look, I was a person whose life revolved around everybody else's problems.
I had no identity other than... the people that I was helping.
My 9-1-1 calls, my dying mother.
I just had no sense of self.
I had to leave everything that I knew so that I could remember who I actually am.
And you did, right?
I mean, you did remember, but...
You still didn't come home.
Yeah, I know.
