Right in here.
Thanks, guys.
(car alarm chirps) (engine starts) (Lorraine screams) Oh!
(Lorraine groaning) Oh, my leg, my leg.
I think it's broken.
Oh, my God, where did you come from?
Sherman Oaks.
Ow!
No.
No, I-I mean, are you okay?
You just hit me with your car! Of course I'm not okay.
That's a really, really nice car.
Is that a custom paint job?
(groans): Oh, really hurts when I move my head.
Is that normal?
(screams): Ow!
* She works hard for the money * So hard for it, honey * She works hard for the money * So you better treat her right *
* She works hard for the money * So hard for it, honey * She works hard for the money * So you better treat her right *
* I met her there (screams) * And she wonders where she is * And it's strange to her * Some people seem to have everything *
* 9:00 a. m. on the hour hand * And she's waiting for the bell *
* And she's looking real pretty *
* She's waiting for her clientele *
* She works hard for the money * So hard for it, honey * She works hard for the money * So you better treat her right. * (Lorraine yelps) (siren wailing, horn honks) LAFD. Step aside, please.
I didn't know what to do.
I was afraid to move the car.
You did the right thing. We'll take it from here.
Do any of you have a pen?
I've got a partial license plate.
Somebody should write it down.
EDDIE: Don't worry about the license plate, ma'am.
It's right here on the back of the car.
Not this car.
The car that hit me.
Uh, wait, this isn't the car that hit you?
No, this is the car that ran me over.
(groans) Better be insured.
Let's just focus on getting you out of here first, ma'am.
BUCK: I think there's enough room. We can slide a backboard under here and pull her out that way.
Okay, c-can you tell me your name?
Lorraine.
(grunts) Hey, wait. Don't we know you?
LORRAINE: Uh, no, I don't...I don't, I don't think so.
HEN: Last year, Hancock Park.
That's right. I never forget a femur.
Hmm.
(chuckles nervously) It's the damned Porch Pirate.
(moans) Guess you moved up from porches to parking lots, huh, Lorraine?
What's your scam?
I don't know what you are talking about.
I went to my court-mandated treatment. I'm completely cured.
Haven't stole a package in months.
Mm-hmm. I heard you settled with that homeowner.
The house she fell in front of when she was package stealing?
I didn't realize you could sue someone for being injured during the commission of a felony.
Pled down to a misdemeanor.
Insurance companies are happy to settle instead of going to court.
Insurance companies are less happy about fraud.
And I got three witnesses who claim you intentionally stepped out behind that poor woman's car.
Makes me wonder what I might find when I pull the security footage from this parking lot.
I think you'll find a woman suffering with mobility issues.
Lot of trouble walking since that fall on the steps.
You know, I wonder if it's because I received improper care on the scene.
(laughs) So you're gonna sue us now?
Oh, you folks are city employees.
Probably don't make that much.
But the city...
There's probably some deep pockets there, don't you think? (moans) Awful woman.
WOMAN (over phone): Isn't it your job to help?
I mean, are you even listening to what I'm saying?
I gave you the address. What else do you need?
Okay, ma'am, if you could just calm down and give me some information.
WOMAN: Are you deaf? You keep asking the same stupid questions, and I keep telling you: I don't know.
Does he have a pulse?
WOMAN: I'm not touching him, lady.
Do you know where he's been injured?
I need a damn ambulance!
Okay.
The ambulance is on the way. If you could just tell me...
WOMAN: Why didn't you say that, you stupid bitch?
Wasting my time.
(dial tone) (groans) (sighs) This'll make you feel better.
Delicious and Paleo.
You made Paleo muffins?
I can barely make lunch. Although I should start, 'cause Jim in the food truck is getting the wrong idea.
So, what's your secret?
Dee's Bakery on Larchmont, but don't tell anyone.
Bad call?
Bad day.
It's like the whole city's in a mood.
That's every day, honey.
There are over 200 languages spoken in the city of Los Angeles, and I've been cursed out in every single one of them.
It's not like I've never been yelled at before.
I mean, I worked in an ER, but...
it just felt different somehow.
You know, maybe it's because I could see them.
I could see that they were scared or in pain, that they didn't mean to be so...
Awful?
Does it ever get to you?
Oh.
I've been doing this for 20 years.
At some point, it gets to everyone.
My Stan always used to say, "Can't bring those people home with you, Gloria.
They'll wear you down." I never realized how right he was until after he was gone.
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
I'm told he's in a better place now.
But the thing I learned is that there's no controlling someone else's behavior.
But how you react to it, that's on you.
No, it's just hard not to take it personally sometimes.
You said you felt different when you could see their faces, right?
Maybe that's what you need.
How? I mean, the system isn't exactly set up for FaceTime.
Go on a ride-along.
In a police car?
It should be part of your training, anyway.
You've heard them on the phone, and you've been there when they were wheeled into the ER.
Now get out and see what happens in between.
(watch beeps) Oh.
Well, time to save the world.
Josh.
Morning, Gloria.
Wow, she really has it all figured out.
She's this place's CÃ©line Dion.
(chuckles) No bull. Just here every day, getting on that stage and giving it her all.
("Gloria" by Them playing) (phone ringing) 911. What is your emergency?
WOMAN: Help, please.
My boyfriend's bleeding. He shot himself with one of those nail guns.
What's your location?
9534 Sycamore. Mount Washington.
Help is on the way.
Do you have a clean cloth you can apply to the wound?
911. What is your emergency?
MAN: Hi. Yeah, I-I think someone is breaking in to the house next door.
Okay, do you see anyone?
No. I-I heard some glass break.
So you're calling because you heard glass breaking?
MAN: What? No. Well, I mean...
I don't know. My neighbors are in Florida.
Can you please just send someone to check it out?
I'd say the real crime is being in Florida at this time of year.
Try calling a window repairman.
911. What's your emergency?
MAN 2: I'm sitting in a coffee shop, and this guy just ran up, grabbed my brand-new bike and took off.
Did he break your legs first?
What? No. What?
Go chase him and get it back.
* G-L-O-R-I-A How long ago did the pain start?
It's probably gas.
CPR? No, I wouldn't bother.
Well, maybe you should have made better life choices.
Sir, I think this amount of crying is a little over the top and unproductive, don't you think?
If you were really going to jump, I doubt you'd be calling me.
(sighs) Gloria, I think you've earned yourself an extra muffin.
Right there.
Athena Grant?
One and only.
Hi, I'm...
Maddie Kendall.
New dispatcher here for your ride-along.
You requested me.
(chuckles) No one ever requests me.
We have someone in common. Kendall's my married name.
I actually used to be Maddie Buckley.
I am again.
Oh, Buckley. You're Buck's sister.
Yeah, ER nurse from Philly.
Hershey. How did you know that?
Oh, Bobby-- uh, Captain Nash-- said that Buck had a sister who was new to town.
Your brother's boss is my boo.
(chuckles) Yeah.
Your brother and I got off on the wrong foot, but, uh, he's grown on me.
Kid's got a heart of gold.
So, I don't have to call you Buck-ette or anything, do I?
(laughs): No, Maddie is fine.
So, how you liking it so far? L. A.
Well, the traffic has exceeded my expectations, and I experienced my first earthquake.
(chuckles) A 7.1, girl.
You're an official Angeleno now.
(indistinct radio chatter) So, you don't have a partner?
Field sergeant.
I go where I want or where I'm needed.
I feel like that's what I'm doing, too.
Or, at least, I hope it is.
Was it bad?
You said your married name was Kendall. You come here to start over?
It was awful.
But I'm not ashamed to talk about it.
I mean, I was.
Now I realize how strong I am for getting out.
The day that every woman in the world realizes how strong she really is is the day that will bring peace on Earth.
DISPATCHER: All Wilshire Division units.
Please respond to a 415 group at Parkview Cemetery.
Request supervisor on scene.
727-L-30. En route.
415. Disturbance?
Yeah. My guess, another military funeral protest.
What kind of people would protest a military funeral?
(siren wailing) * PROTESTORS: Burn in hell will be your fate!
Two, four, six, eight, burn in hell will be your fate!
Two, four, six, eight, burn in hell will be your fate!
Why don't you have some respect?
God is not a respecter of perverts!
Yeah, well, you're not God, are you?
No, and neither are you.
You should be ashamed of yourselves!
I'm not ashamed!
Take all of yourselves home.
You-- No, you can go home.
PROTESTORS: ...burn in hell will be your fate!
Two, four, six, eight, burn in hell will be your fate!
Two, four, six, eight, burn in hell will be your fate!
Two, four, six, eight, burn in hell will be your fate!
Hey, should I stay in the car?
Yeah, stay there.
Coming through. Coming through.
Coming thr...coming through.
Coming through.
Two, four, six, eight...
Officer, can you please, please do something about this?
My-my sister's trying to bury her son.
I understand. And I'm very sorry for your loss, but my best advice is just to ignore them.
Are you kidding me?
They've got bullhorns.
This is a funeral.
Do you see those disgusting signs?
I see 'em, but as long as they stay behind that fence, it's their constitutionally protected right to stand there and be awful.
My nephew volunteered to serve because he believed in protecting the freedom that gives these...
these idiots the right to spew their filth.
I'll do what I can.
(fence rattles) Two, four, six, eight, burn in hell will be your fate!
Okay, sir, you need to stay behind the fence.
Or what?
Or your next stop will be county jail.
Where your black brothers have been duly incarcerated.
(protestors continue chanting) Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
Back it up. I'm not gonna tell you again.
Well, can I just back up, or do I have to pay repar...ations? (coughing) All right, folks, take it back.
Take it behind the fence. Sir...
(choking) Sir? Sir?
Get your hands off me.
Get 'em off. (groaning) 727-L-30, requesting R. A. unit at Parkview Cemetery.
(sirens wailing) Sergeant Grant.
Captain. Mr. Personality over here starting coughing, grabbed his side and fell over.
Could be appendicitis. I'm not sure.
All right, back up.
Step aside, please.
Sir, I'm just gonna examine you for a second here.
Oh. Okay, we got a colostomy bag, probably backing up.
You're gonna have to intubate him. Sir, just try to relax.
These paramedics here are gonna attend to you.
(Scooter groaning) Oh, hell no.
You do it.
BOBBY: Sir, I am not a trained paramedic.
I can't intubate you. They can.
(weakly): I'm fine.
CHIMNEY: Sir, you're not fine.
Your bowel is probably obstructed.
The contents of your colostomy bag are backing up into your system.
You're about to choke on your own waste.
You will suffocate and die.
Get...away.
BOBBY: Okay, sir, if you refuse care, we cannot administer it by force.
SCOOTER (groans): What about him?
"Diaz." Diaz.
What kind of name is that?
My father's from Mexico.
My mother's Swedish. I can help you out with the Swedish half.
But no one told me which half that is.
Okay, would you like me to call you another paramedic team so you can have an all-white one?
Yeah.
He's gonna aspirate.
(retching) And he's aspirating.
Actual diarrhea of the mouth.
Outstanding.
Okay, guys, let's get to work.
Let me roll him over.
Ready, Buck?
Yeah.
Three, two, one.
(gagging) I need mechanical suction.
This isn't cutting it.
We've got suction on the truck.
Let's get him on the gurney. Let's go.
Keep him on his side.
Let's go.
We'll bring the gurney on the other side.
One, two, three, go.
(engine starts) Well done.
Right, your ride-along was today. Uh, Cap, this is my sister Maddie.
Great to finally meet you.
Yeah, you, too. I've heard nothing but wonderful things about you.
Well, don't believe everything your little brother tells you.
I meant from her.
Ah. Well, the feeling is mutual.
She's something. She never lets anything get to her.
Get to me? Do you know how many times in a given day somebody's got the opportunity to get to me?
(chuckles) If I start letting them get to me, I wouldn't make it past breakfast.
Which reminds me, we should eat.
Eat? You want to eat after that?
It's lunchtime.
(laughter) (engine starts) So, you like her?
Abby? Sure.
You don't approve? Is it the age difference?
More like the time difference. Part of me is impressed.
It's the longest relationship my little brother's ever had.
Ah, and the other part?
Can't help but notice she hasn't been here for most of it.
Whoa.
Huh. That's weird.
Hang tight for a second.
Yeah.
Police.
Anyone here?
(gun cocks) (liquid boiling, food sizzling) (loudly): Is anyone here?
(phone line beeping in distance) Sir, can you hear me?
(phone line continues beeping) Sir, can you tell me what happened?
(gasping): Robber. Shot.
727-L-30, requesting R. A. units and additional units at 12507 Wilshire.
Gunshot wound and apparent 211.
No description of the suspect at this time.
MAN (over radio): Copy that. Ten minutes out.
You said he was talking?
Yeah, he said a few words, then he passed out.
Sir? Can you hear me?
(scissors cutting) Uh, okay, um, I need something to seal this with.
The-the air is being pulled into his thoracic cavity instead of his lungs.
Uh, plastic wrap?
Perfect.
Here. Three pieces of tape.
Thanks.
Okay, lost his pulse. Moving to compressions.
Okay, you know what, I need the blood to keep flowing to his heart. Can you elevate his legs?
(gasps) (panting) You're gonna be okay, sir.
The ambulance is almost here.
(weakly): How you here?
They hang up.
ATHENA: Sir?
Who hung up on you?
911.
(phone line continues beeping) I still can't believe it. Who just hangs up?
I mean, if we hadn't been there, he would have died.
And you get a gold star for saving him, Nurse Nellie Forbush, but ten demerit points for jumping to conclusions.
He probably got disconnected. Spotty cell service or he hit a wrong button.
It happens. Sometimes people panic.
Fine.
Do you have the number he called from?
GLORIA (recorded): 911. What is your emergency?
LANH: Help! A robber. He shot me.
GLORIA: What? What did you say?
LANH: Ma Xun Restaurant on Wilshire.
Please, please help. Send help.
I can't understand you.
Speak louder or I'm hanging up.
It can't be her.
LANH: Shot. Bleeding. Help now.
GLORIA: Yelling at me won't stop the bleeding, okay?
I'm not the one who shot you.
(speaking Vietnamese) Seriously?
You're switching to another language now?
(clicks) That wasn't a mistake.
Gloria hung up on him.
Guys?
Careful! Guys, be easy with her.
She's not a puppy.
Hey, listen...
I am glad that Athena got someone new.
Okay? No, I am.
Y-You should have heard what Harry told me the other day.
He says, "Dad, doesn't it seem weird that you're an architect "and Bobby is a firefighter?
"I mean, you're there when the buildings go up, but he's there when it burns down to the ground." (laughter) KAREN: Wow.
Symbolism much?
Hey, you know, Bobby is a good man, and I think that's what makes it a little bit harder.
I mean, he has this natural paternal quality.
KAREN: Well, listen, you don't need to worry.
'Cause you are those babies' father, and they know it.
And anything they get from him is just extra.
Yeah, that's right. (laughs) (toy squeaks) (dog whining) Well, he's amazing. What's his name?
She's a she. Paisley.
My mama rescued her.
I bet she did.
HARRY: Um, where's your dog?
Son of a bitch.
Boys, boys. Let's go, let's go.
Hey, guys, come on. Who wants some food, huh?
You evil...
Excuse me?
What did you say to him?
You mean did I tell him I was his real mother?
Not yet.
You're not his real mother.
You signed away all rights to him the day he was born.
You're right, I signed away all my parental rights.
But he didn't.
Who the hell is he?
That's Nathaniel.
That's Denny's biological father.
He didn't even know he had a kid.
You told me you didn't know who the father was.
I lied.
You're lying now.
Am I?
We'll find out.
I'll see you in court.
(elevator bell dings) Hi. Now's not a good time.
Why don't you take a longer lunch?
What?
Oh, are they reprimanding her for hanging up?
Good.
No.
They're firing her for hang-ups.
Yeah, plural. Hundreds, maybe thousands, going back eight months.
Eight months?!
That last part makes sense.
She went a little squirrelly after the divorce.
Uh, I thought her husband was dead.
She only wishes he were.
She's probably facing criminal charges.
There's precedent.
911 dispatcher in Houston got 18 months for interfering with emergency calls.
(door opens) You! You traitor!
Talk later.
I was nice to you, I helped you.
I showed you where we hide the good coffee pods, and you betrayed me.
They want to put me in jail because of what you said!
You hung up on people on purpose.
Awful people!
People who yell and scream and cry and expect you to do something for them.
I mean, and do they ever say, "How are you?" Do they ever ask, "How are you doing, Gloria?" Do they ever think of anything but themselves and what they need? No!
You give them everything you have, and then they leave you for your sister! You know, Maddie, I'm...
Ma'am, it's time to go.
This...You can't just toss me into the trash!
I won "Outstanding Dispatcher" eight times.
(elevator bell dings) I took more calls than anyone.
Half of them were under 45 seconds.
GLORIA: This isn't over, Maddie!
Just mark my words. Snitches get stitches!
(dog whining) KAREN: But what does that mean for us?
What rights does that give him?
Here. Little man, take Paisley to your room.
(Karen speaks indistinctly) KAREN: Look...Hen just walked in.
Okay.
Thanks, Mark.
Never a good sign hearing from your lawyer after office hours.
Well, the lab report came back.
Nathaniel Green is Denny's biological father.
What does that mean?
It means...he has rights.
It means he could try to take our son away from us.
What does Mark say?
That we're screwed.
I mean, he used more lawyerly words.
Our case is more "challenging" now.
And, "The court will have to "balance the interests of the child against the birth mother's fraudulent acts." HEN: Okay. Okay, listen.
Let me talk to Athena.
There's got to be more to this guy's story.
Maybe she can do some digging, find out something that we can use against him.
All this just because that awful woman wanted to hurt you.
Why did you bring her back into our lives?
Karen, listen.
I was stupid.
Hmm.
I was selfish.
I was weak.
And I'm sorry. I'm so...so very sorry.
I know you're sorry...
and you never meant for any of this to happen.
I know that in my head, but the rest of me...
is having a really hard time.
Mama?
Mama sounded mad.
Yeah, Mommy just got some bad news tonight.
She's just upset.
She was really mad at the park when I talked to that lady.
Is she mad at me?
Mm-mm, not even a little bit.
Mommy and I love you more than anything.
Can you fix the bad thing like you fix people at work?
Yeah.
Don't you worry, little man.
Mama's gonna fix everything.
So she hangs up on a thousand people, and it's your fault she got fired?
Oh, not just fired.
The LAPD has launched an investigation.
She could go to jail, which I guess is also my fault, because I violated a code when I reported her.
I don't even know what that means.
Like, a 911 dispatcher code?
They say cops have that blue line.
Yeah, well, I wear maroon.
Anyway, she just kept texting and calling, so I had to shut my phone off.
(phone vibrating) Ugh. Guess who? Looks like Gloria's not done yelling at me.
BUCK: Want me to talk to her?
No, I just want to ignore her completely, and she'll go away eventually, I hope.
I can't smash another cell phone.
* (engine starts) (siren wailing in distance) (phone vibrating) Hey.
KAREN: Hey. Um...
I'm sorry about before.
This isn't your fault.
I'm just scared. (scoffs) Babe?
Yeah, I'm...
I'm scared, too.
Where are you?
HEN: Just out for a drive. I need to clear my head.
All I feel is rage, just boiling over in me.
Just come home, babe.
I love you.
HEN: I love you, too.
Eva?
Eva!
Open up the damn door! I know you're in there.
Eva!
(glass breaking) Eva?!
Damn it.
(gurgling) (gurgling continues) (line ringing) PARAMEDIC: That's it.
That's good. Okay, sit up for me.
(Eva groans) Lean against the wall there.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
(Eva sighs softly) No.
What the hell is she doing here?
PARAMEDIC: She called it in.
Saved your life.
That's because she loves me.
(Hen scoffs, laughs) I don't even hate you, Eva.
I feel nothing for you.
Then why were you here?
I called your parole officer.
He'll meet you at the hospital.
Good luck in prison.
You saved me, Hen!
I save awful people every day. It's my job.
Sergeant Grant. You're the one called it in?
I saw the bulletin you guys sent out about your robbery suspect.
Mm-hmm.
Patient just came in. White man in his 20s with untreated burns and a sketchy demeanor.
Yeah. Victim threw hot oil in his face.
I thought he might seek medical treatment.
This one said he did it grilling, but the burn pattern's all wrong.
Plus, the wounds are more than a day old.
He's got a massive infection and keeps screaming about the pain.
Well, let's see if we can't give him something to take his mind off that.
(knocks on door) Mr. Davis, can I come in?
(glass breaking) 727-L-30 requesting R. A. unit at Carthay Urgent Care, 2952 Carlson Avenue.
I have an unconscious suspect in need of medical attention.
You got him?
ATHENA (over phone): Yeah.
Owner got him good with that hot oil.
Burns were like a scarlet letter all over his face, except the "A" didn't stand for "adulterer" in this particular case.
MADDIE: What about the restaurant owner?
Out of ICU and on the mend.
Amazing.
Hey, thanks for letting me ride shotgun with you.
Sure.
Nothing like some blood and bile and bullets to help you see how special it is what you do on that phone every day.
MADDIE: First of all, I'm pretty sure that wasn't bile.
And second, it wasn't just the calls that we answered, it was you.
I mean, now if I have a moment of doubt, I can just say, "What would Athena do?" You're too kind. (laughs) I guess those golden hearts run in the Buckley family.
Take care, Buck-ette.
You, too, Sergeant.
(phone vibrates) Hello.
GLORIA (over phone): Maddie.
Glad I finally got you.
(sighs) Stop calling me.
Stop texting me.
Leave me alone.
GLORIA: But I have so much free time now.
I could call you all day.
MADDIE (over speaker): I mean, what do you want from me?
Do you want me to say that I'm sorry for turning you in for almost killing a man?
I'm not.
I tried to teach you something important.
Oh, here's a little something I learned.
(sighs) (dialing) (line ringing) This call is being recorded.
I think I might be having an actual emergency.
Unbelievable. How did you even...?
GLORIA: Get transferred to you directly?
This is Officer Donnelly.
513-Mary-12. Responding to a 207.
I've got an 11-58 and need to keep off the airwaves.
Can you patch me through to my dispatcher?
Who is Officer Donnelly?
I made her up. (laughs) Because I know the system, Maddie.
Until yesterday, I was the system.
But you took that from me.
Ma'am, it is against the law to call 911 for non-emergencies.
It's also a crime to impersonate a police officer.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to report this.
Don't you dare "ma'am" me or tell me about the law.
Your whole generation is nothing but a bunch of lazy ingrates.
You have no clue what it's like...(screams) (groaning) MADDIE: Gloria?
(Gloria groans) MADDIE: What just happened? Gloria?
Maddie?
Are you still there?
I think I was in an accident.
MADDIE: I-I'm here. Where are you?
(door thuds) (grunts softly) (moans) (whimpering): I can't get out.
I can't get out.
I'm stuck.
Why can't I hear you?
Gloria, I'm here.
Did you hang up?
I'm here. I don't think she can hear me.
God, I hope you didn't hang up.
The airbags probably deployed.
GLORIA: I mean...
She wouldn't be able to hear anything.
GLORIA: It's definitely what I would have done, but I hope you didn't do it.
Okay, so we'll have to do this the hard way.
Cell tower is giving me this radius, but I don't see any reports in the area.
SUE: Okay, here.
I have to call someone.
But I lost my phone.
MADDIE: Air Support, I need assistance getting a visual on a vehicle.
I really wish you were still on the line.
I wouldn't blame you if you hung up on me.
That's what I would have done.
I don't know why. That's a lie.
I do know why.
Dead-end calls.
Not sure if you've had one yet, but it's when you can hear everything that's happening on the other end of the line, and you know there's not gonna be anything that you can do.
Except sit there and listen to someone die.
(sighs) It happened to me.
Stan had served me with papers that morning, and I, and I got a call from this girl.
She was hiding under a desk because...
a client came in with a gun.
I could hear the shots-- one, then another.
Getting closer.
(crying): I knew what was coming, so I...
I just, I...
I hung up.
And I-I felt so relieved.
She wasn't my problem anymore.
After that, nothing was my problem.
Until you.
You're gonna be okay, Gloria.
Since I'm making my peace, I...
I don't know if I should...
apologize to you or...
or forgive you, but I should do more...
(horn honking) You didn't hang up.
You didn't.
No.
You're here.
I'm still here.
(sighs) He's a straight arrow.
Owns his own home.
Stable job.
Manager at Home Depot.
Employee of the month three times.
Yeah, good credit.
And he counsels at-risk kids on the weekends.
Oh, you got to be joking me.
How are we gonna win against this guy?
He's freaking perfect.
He wasn't always.
Seven years ago, he was a mess.
He started drinking after his wife died of ovarian cancer.
Series of DUIs landed him in rehab.
Where he met Eva.
Mm-hmm.
I-I still-- I can't believe she's doing this.
That she could hate me so much.
Eva isn't your problem anymore.
She broke her parole. Hard.
She's going back inside.
I had this moment, 'Thena, I was standing over her.
And I thought about just...not helping her.
I almost let her die.
Does that make me an awful person?
Mm-mm.
It makes you a human being.
A good one.
Because despite everything that she put you through, you still saved her ungrateful ass.
And now this...
this man can come and take my son.
My wife will not forever forgive me for that.
Stop. Enough of that.
No one's taking Denny.
All right? This isn't about that.
All he wants is visitation.
Yeah, he has a case, but so do you and Karen.
You love that boy.
And anyone who spends five minutes with you can see that.
This Nathaniel Green will, too.
But will he care?
You got to have faith.
* Yeah, people can be awful.
Selfish and cruel.
* Lately...
Caring only about themselves and what they want and need.
* No holding back * No point in wasting sorrow * On things that won't be here tomorrow * Never thinking about who they hurt, or what kind of damage they might leave in their wake.
Oh, good, you're conscious.
Just need to have a few words with you.
What?
First up, you have the right to remain silent.
(crying) * Tell me it's okay BOBBY: Gloria? Gloria, my name is Bobby. We're here to help.
Okay. Yeah.
Okay, just try to stay calm.
You're gonna be all right.
Okay.
Okay? We're gonna cut you out of there.
ATHENA: But not everyone is awful.
There's some good ones out there, too.
The kind who want to do the right thing.
* I know it's a shame * Maddie, good work.
Gloria said some pretty awful things.
I'm glad you didn't let it get to you.
That's the job, right?
If I let everyone get to me, I wouldn't make it past breakfast.
ATHENA: But you'll never know which kind of person someone is unless you give them a chance to show you.
* I have spent so much of my time * NATHANIEL: I can tell Denny has a good life here.
* To be of use And I don't want to harm that in any way.
You're his parents.
You tell me what's best for him and I'll follow your lead.
ATHENA: Maybe they'll surprise you...
in the best way.
* I know it's a shame BOBBY: Okay, everybody, let's eat.
Hen. How'd it go?
Good.
Great.
I think it's gonna be okay.
(clears throat) Yes, Athena.
You were right.
(laughs) BOBBY: She usually is.
In fact, I find it best just not to argue with her.
* Shame.
ATHENA: Our lives are shaped, not just by our experiences, but by relationships.
Who we love.
Who loves us.
And the stronger those ties are, the less awful everything else seems.
