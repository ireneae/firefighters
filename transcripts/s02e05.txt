LAFD. Step aside, please.
I didn't know what to do.
I was afraid to move the car.
You did the right thing. We'll take it from here.
Do any of you have a pen?
I've got a partial license plate.
Somebody should write it down.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Don't worry about the license plate, ma'am.
It's right here on the back of the car.
Not this car.
The car that hit me.
Uh, wait, this isn't the car that hit you?
No, this is the car that ran me over.
(<em>Groans</em>) Better be insured.
Let's just focus on getting you out of here first, ma'am.

Okay, c-can you tell me your name?
Lorraine.
(<em>Grunts</em>)
Hey, wait. Don't we know you?
<strong>Lorraine</strong>: Uh, no, I don't... I don't, I don't think so.
<strong>Hen</strong>: Last year, Hancock Park.
That's right. I never forget a femur.
Hmm.
(<em>Chuckles nervously</em>)
It's the damned Porch Pirate.
(<em>Moans</em>)
Guess you moved up from porches to parking lots, huh, Lorraine?
What's your scam?
I don't know what you are talking about.
I went to my court-mandated treatment. I'm completely cured.
Haven't stole a package in months.
Mm-hmm. I heard you settled with that homeowner.
The house she fell in front of when she was package stealing?
I didn't realize you could sue someone for being injured during the commission of a felony.
Pled down to a misdemeanor.
Insurance companies are happy to settle instead of going to court.
Insurance companies are less happy about fraud.
And I got three witnesses who claim you intentionally stepped out behind that poor woman's car.
Makes me wonder what I might find when I pull the security footage from this parking lot.
I think you'll find a woman suffering with mobility issues.
Lot of trouble walking since that fall on the steps.
You know, I wonder if it's because I received improper care on the scene.
(<em>Laughs</em>) So you're gonna sue us now?
Oh, you folks are city employees.
Probably don't make that much.
But the city...
There's probably some deep pockets there, don't you think? (<em>Moans</em>)
Awful woman.
<strong>Woman (<em>over phone</em>)</strong>: Isn't it your job to help?
I mean, are you even listening to what I'm saying?
I gave you the address. What else do you need?
Okay, ma'am, if you could just calm down and give me some information.
<strong>Woman</strong>: Are you deaf? You keep asking the same stupid questions, and I keep telling you: I don't know.
Does he have a pulse?
<strong>Woman</strong>: I'm not touching him, lady.
Do you know where he's been injured?
I need a damn ambulance!
Okay.
The ambulance is on the way. If you could just tell me...
<strong>Woman</strong>: Why didn't you say that, you stupid b¡tch?
Wasting my time.

You made Paleo muffins?
I can barely make lunch. Although I should start, 'cause Jim in the food truck is getting the wrong idea.
So, what's your secret?

Bad call?
Bad day.
It's like the whole city's in a mood.
That's every day, honey.
There are over 200 languages spoken in the city of Los Angeles, and I've been cursed out in every single one of them.
It's not like I've never been yelled at before.
I mean, I worked in an ER, but... it just felt different somehow.
You know, maybe it's because I could see them.
I could see that they were scared or in pain, that they didn't mean to be so...
Awful?
Does it ever get to you?
Oh.
I've been doing this for 20 years.
At some point, it gets to everyone.
My Stan always used to say, &quot;Can't bring those people home with you, Gloria.
They'll wear you down.&quot;
I never realized how right he was until after he was gone.
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
I'm told he's in a better place now.
But the thing I learned is that there's no controlling someone else's behavior.
But how you react to it, that's on you.
No, it's just hard not to take it personally sometimes.
You said you felt different when you could see their faces, right?
Maybe that's what you need.
How? I mean, the system isn't exactly set up for FaceTime.
Go on a ride-along.
In a police car?
It should be part of your training, anyway.
You've heard them on the phone, and you've been there when they were wheeled into the ER.
Now get out and see what happens in between.

Oh.
Well, time to save the world.

No. I-I heard some glass break.
So you're calling because you heard glass breaking?
<strong>Man</strong>: What? No. Well, I mean...

Maddie Kendall.

You requested me.
(<em>Chuckles</em>) No one ever requests me.
We have someone in common. Kendall's my married name.
I actually used to be Maddie Buckley.
I am again.
Oh, Buckley. You're Buck's sister.
Yeah, ER nurse from Philly.
Hershey. How did you know that?
Oh, Bobby... uh, Captain Nash...
Said that Buck had a sister who was new to town.
Your brother's boss is my boo.
(<em>Chuckles</em>) Yeah.
Your brother and I got off on the wrong foot, but, uh, he's grown on me.
Kid's got a heart of gold.
So, I don't have to call you Buck-ette or anything, do I?
(<em>Laughs</em>): No, Maddie is fine.
So, how you liking it so far? L.A.
Well, the traffic has exceeded my expectations, and I experienced my first earthquake.
(<em>Chuckles</em>) A 7.1, girl.
You're an official Angeleno now.
(<em>Indistinct radio chatter</em>)
So, you don't have a partner?
Field sergeant.
I go where I want or where I'm needed.
I feel like that's what I'm doing, too.
Or, at least, I hope it is.
Was it bad?
You said your married name was Kendall. You come here to start over?
It was awful.
But I'm not ashamed to talk about it.
I mean, I was.
Now I realize how strong I am for getting out.
The day that every woman in the world realizes how strong she really is is the day that will bring peace on Earth.

Okay.
Thanks, Mark.
Never a good sign hearing from your lawyer after office hours.
Well, the lab report came back.
Nathaniel Green <em>is</em> Denny's biological father.
What does that mean?
It means... he has rights.
It means he could try to take our son away from us.
What does Mark say?
That we're screwed.
I mean, he used more lawyerly words.
Our case is more &quot;challenging&quot; now.
And, &quot;The court will have to balance the interests of the child against the birth mother's fraudulent acts.&quot;
Okay, okay, listen.
Let me talk to Athena.
There's got to be more to this guy's story.
Maybe she can do some digging, find out something that we can use against him.
All this just because that awful woman wanted to hurt you.
Why did you bring her back into our lives?
Karen, listen.
I was stupid.
Hmm.
I was selfish.
I was weak.
And I'm sorry. I'm so... so very sorry.
I know you're sorry... and you never meant for any of this to happen.
I know that in my head, but the rest of me... is having a really hard time.

Can you fix the bad thing like you fix people at work?
Yeah.
Don't you worry, little man.
Mama's gonna fix everything.
So she hangs up on a thousand people, and it's your fault she got fired?
Oh, not just fired.
The LAPD has launched an investigation.
She could go to jail, which I guess is also my fault, because I violated a code when I reported her.
I don't even know what that means.
Like, a 911 dispatcher code?
They say cops have that blue line.
Yeah, well, I wear maroon.
Anyway, she just kept texting and calling, so I had to shut my phone off.

Your whole generation is nothing but a bunch of lazy ingrates.
You have no clue what it's like... (<em>Screams</em>)
(<em>Groaning</em>)
<strong>Maddie</strong>: Gloria?
(<em>Gloria groans</em>)
<strong>Maddie</strong>: What just happened? Gloria?
Maddie?
Are you still there?
I think I was in an accident.
<strong>Maddie</strong>: I-I'm here. Where are you?
(<em>Door thuds</em>)
(<em>Grunts softly</em>)
(<em>Moans</em>)
(<em>Whimpering</em>): I can't get out.
I can't get out.
I'm stuck.
Why can't I hear you?
Gloria, I'm here.
Did you hang up?
I'm here. I don't think she can hear me.
God, I hope you didn't hang up.
The airbags probably deployed.
<strong>Gloria</strong>: I mean...
She wouldn't be able to hear anything.
<strong>Gloria</strong>: It's definitely what I would have done, but I hope you didn't do it.
Okay, so we'll have to do this the hard way.
Cell tower is giving me this radius, but I don't see any reports in the area.
<strong>Sue</strong>: Okay, here.
I have to call someone.
But I lost my phone.
<strong>Maddie</strong>: Air Support, I need assistance getting a visual on a vehicle.
I really wish you were still on the line.
I wouldn't blame you if you hung up on me.
That's what I would have done.
I don't know why. That's a lie.
I do know why.
Dead-end calls.
Not sure if you've had one yet, but it's when you can hear everything that's happening on the other end of the line, and you know there's not gonna be anything that you can do.
Except sit there and listen to someone die.
(<em>Sighs</em>)
It happened to me.
Stan had served me with papers that morning, and I, and I got a call from this girl.
She was hiding under a desk because... a client came in with a gun.
I could hear the shots... one, then another.
Getting closer.
(<em>Crying</em>): I knew what was coming, so I...
I just, I...
I hung up.
And I-I felt so relieved.
She wasn't my problem anymore.
After that, nothing was my problem.
Until you.
You're gonna be okay, Gloria.
Since I'm making my peace, I...
I don't know if I should... apologize to you or... or forgive you, but I should do more...
(<em>Horn honking</em>)
You didn't hang up.
You didn't.
No.
You're here.
I'm still here.
(<em>Sighs</em>)
<strong>Athena</strong>: He's a straight arrow.
Owns his own home.
Stable job.
Manager at Home Depot.
Employee of the month three times.
Yeah, good credit.
And he counsels at-risk kids on the weekends.
Oh, you got to be joking me.
How are we gonna win against this guy?
He's freaking perfect.
He wasn't always.
Seven years ago, he was a mess.
He started drinking after his wife died of ovarian cancer.
Series of DUIs landed him in rehab.
Where he met Eva.
Mm-hmm.
I-I still... I can't believe she's doing this.
That she could hate me so much.
Eva isn't your problem anymore.
She broke her parole. Hard.
She's going back inside.
I had this moment, 'Thena, I was standing over her.
And I thought about just... not helping her.
I almost let her die.
Does that make me an awful person?
Mm-mm.
It makes you a human being.
A good one.
Because despite everything that she put you through, you still saved her ungrateful ass.
And now this... this man can come and take my son.
My wife will not forever forgive me for that.
Stop. Enough of that.
No one's taking Denny.
All right? This isn't about that.
All he wants is visitation.
Yeah, he has a case, but so do you and Karen.
You love that boy.
And anyone who spends five minutes with you can see that.
This Nathaniel Green will, too.
But will he care?
You got to have faith.
