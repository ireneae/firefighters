How long has the pursuit been going?
Six minutes, high speed.
Armed suspect and his girlfriend.
<i>-MAN: Shots fired, shots fired.</i> Copy that, shots fired.
This thing's gonna start generating other calls.
It's gonna be a day.
911. What's your emergency?
<i> WOMAN:</i> <i> Yeah, my boyfriend's driving</i> <i> the car you guys are chasing.</i> <i> MAN: What the hell</i> <i> are you doing?</i> <i> Making sure these people know</i> <i> that I got no part of this.</i> <i> Hang up, now!</i> Are you hurt, ma'am? <i> No, but</i> <i> he's gonna get me killed.</i> <i> MAN:</i> <i> Put that phone down now,</i> <i> you crazy bitch.</i> Doreen, you need to tell him to pull over and surrender peacefully. <i> He won't listen.</i> Okay, stay on the line with me.
I've got his girlfriend on the line.
Tell her to get him to stop.
I tried that. He's not interested.
Try again.
Do you have any idea where he's headed? <i> Probably to his mama.</i> <i> She's over on Wetherly.</i> <i> Always runs to her</i> <i> when he has a problem.</i> <i> MAN: Are you crazy? Don't</i> <i> tell them that. Give me that!</i> Okay, suspect's mother lives on Wetherly.
He might be heading her way.
Dispatching additional units.
What about spike strips?
They're not in position for that.
How we doing, Doreen?
<i> He's slowing down!</i> <i> He's slowing down!</i> Girlfriend says car's slowing down.
<i> Whatever, mama's boy!</i> All units, all units be advised suspect is abandoning his vehicle.
Suspect is about to be on foot.
Airship's up, en route now.
Finally.
<i> DOREEN:</i> <i> He's running. What do I do?</i> Okay, stay in the vehicle and await police instructions.
Did he leave the weapon or take it with him?
<i> DOREEN:</i> <i> He's got it with him.</i> All units, suspect remains armed.
Girlfriend is in vehicle, unarmed, awaiting instruction.
Name is Doreen.
Claudette, I had a pursuit here last week.
The suspects fled down the alley between Armadale and York Street.
Behind the burger place. Just have them take the alley cutout: Armadale and York.
Not now. Linda, give me something.
Airship's on the scene, joining pursuit.
Okay.
Mom's house is six blocks away.
Units are on the way to intercept.
And here I thought for once we'd go through a whole shift without a pursuit.
Josh, you knew better than to make that bet.
<i> OFFICER: 44. We are now</i> <i> in foot pursuit,</i> <i> approaching Armadale.</i> Copy. In foot pursuit.
Units, if you take the alley between Armadale and York, you should be able to cut the suspect off.
<i> OFFICER 2: 41 copy,</i> <i> taking Armadale alley.</i> <i> OFFICER 3:</i> <i> Adam 33 in the area.</i> <i> We'll cover the</i> <i> York Street side.</i> <i> Stop! Show me your hands.</i> <i> On the ground, now.</i> <i> OFFICER:</i> <i> Dispatch, we're Code 4.</i> Copy.
Code 4. <i> Suspect in custody.</i> JOSH: Nice job.
The alley cutoff was inspired.
Yeah, it seemed like the obvious call.
"Obvious call"? Yeah, obvious, because I told her to do it.
So, you want the credit.
I just want an acknowledgement that other people exist in her world.
You don't know what she's like.
Oh, no, I know the type.
I had more than a few sergeants just like her coming up.
Yeah, that sort of behavior went out a long time ago.
She's a dinosaur, a bully.
I just need to stand up to her, I know.
Yeah, stand up for yourself.
Talk to her. Work it out.
Well, I thought we had, but with Claudette it's always two steps forward, and then get stabbed in the back.
If anything's pushing me to go to college, it's her.
No, you do that because you want to go, not because you were chased there.
Well, thank you, guys, and thank you for breakfast.
Mm-hmm.
Have a wonderful day, sweetheart.
Thank you. I have another shift.
All right. Go get 'em.
Hey. Maybe you should talk to the dinosaur.
No, no, no. I promised May I wouldn't.
What about Sue? Did you promise not to talk to her, too?
So you think I should ask to speak to the manager?
Yes. And if you don't, I will.
Don't you think that's a little extreme?
The fire captain showing up at Dispatch to file a complaint?
Mess with my kid, you mess with me.
You know what I mean.
Oh, I do, and it's sweet.
But don't you go down there, Papa Bear.
(takes deep breath) Understood.
<i> CHIMNEY:</i> <i> That was the nicest leasing</i> <i> office I've been in.</i> I think that was eucalyptus in that diffuser, huh?
Okay, Orrington Plaza.
Oh, this place is great. Huge pool, spa.
And the gym has a Narcissus machine.
Wow. You know, this is historic.
It is?
Albert, there comes a time in every big brother's life when he is set free.
Free to stop worrying about the fate of his little bro.
Oh, God.
Look at you.
Your days of couch surfing, guest room haunting and general freeloading are coming to an end.
Don't get ahead of yourself. I'm not sure I even like it.
And besides, the leasing office already said they're not gonna go month-to-month.
What if I don't have a job in six months?
Why wouldn't you have a job?
You're not getting fired or something, are you?
I just think that maybe the job's harder than I thought it would be.
The first year's always hard.
It just takes some time to find your sea legs.
You just gotta hang in there.
My probationary year is almost over.
Shouldn't I have found them by now?
Maybe... I'm just not cut out for this.
Come on. You're my brother.
You were born to do this, just like me.
Still don't like the place.
Then we'll keep looking, all right, little brother?
(beeps) (sighs) Terry? (sighs) Must we commit to going paperless on a day when my tablet is acting up?
Again?
It's probably user error. Again.
I'll take a look when I'm done moving these, and you guys wanted to go paperless.
Correction. He did.
I didn't realize it was going to be a parade.
Scanner's on two, so we have to bring paperwork from high and low, literally.
It's more like a ballet.
How about more Twyla and less Fosse?
I'll try.
After I google what that means.
How's your coffee?
(chuckles) I have to say, I never thought-- not in a million years-- that I would love a superfood creamer made from coconut milk and marine algae.
The algae's where they get the calcium.
(laughing): You truly have become one of us.
Yeah.
But maybe you're not planning on being one of us forever?
Uh...
the whole desk thing is still a little new to me.
I'm used to being out there, riding the rig, slinging the hoses, working up a sweat.
You don't work up a sweat slinging tweets?
Different kind of sweat.
(laughs) When I was in my 20s, my mother liked to say, repeatedly, "Linda, you can tie yourself in knots "trying to find a career that suits you, "but at the end of the day, God will tell you where you need to be in this world." Mm.
Well, I hope he gives me a shout soon.
Yeah.
You took my ambulance?!
Excuse you?
You redirected my ambulance.
That unit was closer to a higher priority emergency, a bigger casualty risk.
But I'd already told my caller that...
Did you get a unit there?
Yes.
And was your victim alive when you disconnected?
(scoffs) That's not the point.
But it is, sweetie. That's exactly the point.
We're not children here competing for the best LEGOs to build our pretend skyscrapers with.
We are a team.
Is that what we are?
We're a team? Why didn't I think of that?
I don't know.
Youth? Inexperience?
Indifference? You tell me.
No.
The rest of us are a team, but you're not.
Sweetie...
I'm not your sweetie!
Enough! Come with me.
Get your girl, Sue.
SUE: Both of you. Let's go.
Terry, it's not even lunch yet, and I am having a day.
My tablet won't work, I've got boxes all over my call center.
How else are you going to turn my world upside down?
Can I help you?
You're not Terry.
No.
He just took off.
Okay.
I'll just, uh...
Who are you?
Carson. I'm installing the new clean agent system.
Oh. Clean agents.
Much better than the dirty agent, am I right?
Right.
(metallic clacking nearby) It's a fire suppression system.
Oh, I'm aware. Dispatchers know all about this stuff.
It uses the inert gas to suck all the oxygen out of the room.
Thought only my mother could do that.
It would suffocate her pretty quick.
Yeah, leaves you breathless I guess.
Always wondered what that felt like.
(clears throat) Oh, I should introduce myself.
I'm...
Josh.
Wait. You know my name?
Terry was giving me the grand tour yesterday, and, um, I asked about you.
You seem really good at what you do.
Thanks.
I, uh... I'm gonna go down to the basement and connect power to this thing.
Yeah, I'll go with you.
Uh, to the elevator.
Isn't Dispatch upstairs?
Yeah, you know what? You're right.
(chuckles) Nice meeting you, clean agent, uh...
Carson.
Yeah.
I'm much nicer than that other agent.
Oh. Yeah.
(laughs) Nice. You got us sent to the principal's office.
Shouldn't have stolen my ambulance.
Oh, are you feeling nostalgic for middle school again?
You only graduated, what, last week?
Give it a rest.
(Claudette chuckles) Well, this is tragic.
Oh, you want to know what's tragic?
The fact that you're still talking.
(scoffs) Finally.
And you.
I expected more from you.
So, welcome to the quiet room.
Designed for dispatchers who need a little time off the floor, or in this case, a time-out.
(buzzing) (beeps) Carson, I just got an alert about the fire suppression system.
(rhythmic beeping) What the hell?
(rhythmic beeping continues) Oh!
(electrical hissing) (screaming) What is that?
(electrical buzzing) (sighs) Well, I need to go and check on whatever that was.
Try not to kill each other while I'm gone.
We can't spare the resources.
(hissing) No! No!
(knocking) Hey.
Hey.
Did you get it, too?
Yeah, power surge.
No, this alert.
"Fire suppression system." Is that the sprinklers or the new CAS?
It's that, uh, waterless system.
Yeah, sucks all the oxygen out of a room.
I met the guy who was installing it.
Hmm. If you met him, you should go talk to him.
Oh, uh, I-I can't.
I've-I've got the floor, and Sue is dealing with, um...
Oh. Yeah, I heard it.
Everyone heard.
All right, I'm on it.
Great.
(gasping) (coughing) (elevator bell dings) (beeping) Terry?! Terry?!
(alarm buzzing) All right, come on, Terry.
Terry? Hey, there we go.
Terry, can you hear me?
Yeah. Yeah.
System shorted out.
Couldn't make it to the door.
Hmm.
Okay.
All right. (panting) Can you hold yourself up?
Yeah.
All right.
(Terry panting) Be right back.
♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. This is <i> Firefighter Eddie Diaz</i> <i> on a department-wide channel.</i> <i> We have a fire</i> <i> at Metro Dispatch downtown.</i> <i>Point of origin appears to be on</i> <i> the second floor records room.</i> All non-essential personnel begin <i> evacuation procedures.</i> Repeat. This is Firefighter Eddie Diaz.
Metro Dispatch is on fire.
Why is this even in here?
Okay. How long before you think we can head back there and just tell them we worked it all out?
I have no idea.
Okay, you know what? We need a plan.
Let me see if I can figure out how to save the day again.
And don't worry. You can take all the credit again, too.
Are you really seriously about to throw another temper tantrum?
I did not throw a tantrum!
Rockabye baby.
Listen, we are now in the quiet room, so you might want to use this time to be alone with your thoughts.
So allow me to provide you with one.
You stood in the middle of the floor yelling and lecturing me about not being a team player.
And yet, your panties are all in a bunch because you didn't get the credit.
Let me tell you something, baby girl.
There's no "I" in "team." Think about that.
(sirens wailing) All right, guys, let's get ready to go.
Captain Shore.
Captain Nash. You're first on the scene.
BOBBY: Eddie.
Records room on the second floor is fully involved.
Fire could spread to the third floor. That's the main floor.
Hen. The clean agent system knocked him out for a second.
He took in a lot of gas, but there could be a lingering narcotic effect.
Okay, I got him.
Okay, Hen, I want you to set up a triage area in the parking garage next door.
Copy that, Cap. I'm gonna need a hand.
It is Monday.
Fine. You'll do.
Happy to help.
HEN: All right, let's go.
Jonah, take Meyers and Ortiz with you.
Okay. Come on, guys.
What do you think? Triage over there, so they could put the command center here?
Yeah, works for me. I'll get it rolling.
Okay. Come on.
So let's get these vehicles removed.
I want immediate, minor and delayed over here, command post officers and assistants over there.
There's going to be a lot of smoke inhalation, so stack up the O2 bottles as the rescues respond in.
And give me plenty of room to work.
I need my space.
I want crews at the Delta side, as well.
Chimney, put together a team from the 133, raise the ladders and start hitting that corner window.
Copy that. Han, you're with me.
Guess we're working together. Should be fun.
Rookie, do everything I tell you to do.
Or not.
Buck, Lucy, suit up. You're going inside.
You're gonna hit the fire at the source on two.
Go.
Go.
(sighs) You're right.
I wanted the credit. The validation, I guess.
And maybe it was me being all Gen-Z, but I was trying to stand up for everybody.
You know, we don't do enough of that in this world.
That's kind of deep.
For real.
Hmm.
You should have read my college essay.
Wait.
Why aren't you in college?
Why do you care?
Girl.
I wasn't ready to go.
I just needed more time, but now I'm out of time, and USC sent me this letter, and they want me to make my decision, and I'm still trying to figure out what to do.
(sighs) You should quit.
Yeah, you would love that.
No, I wouldn't.
I told you once that I saw greatness in you.
And you know I don't say anything I don't mean.
But maybe your greatness is meant for something else.
Like what?
I don't know.
And you don't know, either.
'Cause you've got your whole life ahead of you.
Get the hell out of here and go to college.
Hang around with some people your own age.
Fill your head with some knowledge, and do some things. Some crazy things, some courageous things, and maybe even some naughty things.
(both chuckle) Because... this job, it comes with a price, and it's a heavy one.
And it's also one I never want to see you have to pay.
You know I'm right.
Because you're always right.
Yeah, and because if you were sure you wanted to be a dispatcher for the rest of your life, you'd have already thrown that letter away.
Captain Nash, my people are initializing our disaster protocols, which means they're gonna need help turning a sizable part of that parking garage into a mobile dispatch center so we can keep taking calls.
How's the volume?
Oh, it's unusually high.
There's no way that Valley can handle all the traffic. (coughs) Contact Paramedic Greenway from the 133 and coordinate with him.
Any of my people can help you set up.
Well, thank you. Oh, I also have five of my senior dispatchers still taking calls upstairs.
Unless the fire's encroaching, they won't stand down till we get the trunk line connected.
You said senior dispatchers.
So May has been evacuated?
She's still up there?
I put her in the quiet room with Claudette.
I am so sorry. With all this craziness, I forgot.
Where is this quiet room?
It's on the third floor.
It's behind main dispatch.
That's just above the source of the fire.
SUE: What?!
Eddie, get some turnouts.
Now. Go. Captain Shore, I'm passing the baton.
You're the new IC. I'm going in.
Why is Cap going in?
May's still up there.
Feels like I'm missing something.
Family history.
Let's go.
BOBBY: Donato, you're with me. Eddie, you're with Buck.
Let's hit it.
Why it so hot in here?
Yeah.
It's hotter on this side.
Yeah.
It feels like it's coming from someplace over here.
Something's wrong. Something's very wrong.
MAY: Claudette, get back.
(echoes): Claudette, get back.
Get back!
(muttering): I don't like fire.
I don't like it. I don't like fire.
I don't like fire.
TAYLOR: If you're just joining us, the Downtown Metro Dispatch Center has suffered some kind of power surge which, as you can see, has sparked a fire inside the building.
Evacuations are in progress, although I'm hearing that the danger has not spread to the actual dispatch floor yet.
(coughing) There's no way out the other direction.
(panting) Both hallways are fully involved.
But somebody's got to be coming for us.
Nobody's coming. They can't save us.
Claudette, we're in the 911 call center.
Someone should be coming to find us.
Okay, give me your jacket so I can wet it.
Come on! Give me your jacket.
(coughing) Oh, my God. Claudette.
I don't like fire. (sniffles) Sue, I'm fine now. I can help.
Oh, good.
So, I've reconciled the duty roster and the visitor log.
Everybody in the building is accounted for except for May and Claudette.
I know they're gonna get them out of there.
So, this is the only other name. He signed in this morning.
Carson. Yeah, he was installing the clean agent system.
When was the last time you saw him?
I don't remember.
Okay, let's go.
<i> SHORE:</i> <i> This is Captain Shore.</i> <i> I need two firefighters</i> <i> for search and rescue.</i> <i> Worker named Carson Hayes,</i> <i> last seen on level two,</i> <i>could still be in the building.</i> This is Diaz. Buckley and I<i> are</i> on two.
We swept the whole floor.
This is dispatcher Russo.
<i> I think I know where he is.</i> Go ahead, Josh.
<i> He told me he was going</i> <i> to the basement</i> to connect power to the system.
It's probably the electrical vault.
I can meet you on two and take you down there.
Negative, we got this. Buck!
Take this for me.
I got it.
But I-I'm right by the fire stairs.
I-I could be down there right away.
Josh, you're a dispatcher, not a firefighter.
Today, you're a guest in this house.
He's been waiting months to say that.
SUE: Captain Shore, good news.
Mobile dispatch is almost ready to go live.
SHORE: Maybe not that ready.
Fire's broke through to the third floor.
That roof might be compromised.
Along with that radio tower.
SUE: Well, that's our only connection to every truck, ladder and ambulance in the city.
And not just downtown.
Valley, too?
All of it.
SUE: If that tower goes, it doesn't matter how many calls we take.
We can't send anyone to rescue anyone anywhere.
Han brothers, take this ladder, reposition it to the roof.
Take a team up there and start venting it.
And secure that tower.
Copy that.
Albert.
All right, Albert, once I clear this area, you're good to go!
ALBERT: Copy that.
CHIMNEY: All right.
Get me ventilation here to there. Move!
How we doing up there, Han?
If we bind the straps to the base of this tower, think we'll be golden.
What do you think about over there?
CHIMNEY: Sounds like a plan.
Albert!
Albert.
(grunts) Are you okay? Are you hurt?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Are you sure?
You're not dizzy? Can you see? How many of me are there?
Thankfully just the one. I couldn't handle more of you.
(Claudette coughing) I don't know why the sprinklers aren't on.
It's getting closer.
You think it's gonna knock?
It goes everywhere, eats everything.
Claudette.
Smells like meat.
When it cooks you, and your-your blood burns, too.
That smells like copper.
Claudette.
Can't forget that smell.
Sometimes I remember, comes out of nowhere.
Hits like a...
(fire whooshes) (Claudette grunts) Claudette, listen to me.
You didn't die then, and you're not gonna die now.
Don't worry, don't worry. It only hurts for a sec.
Then it takes your nerve endings out.
You won't feel a thing. You won't-- You won't feel a thing, o-okay?
No, you won't feel it. We won't feel it.
We won't feel...
LUCY: Cap, we can't get to them this way.
(echoing): Cap.
Cap? What's the plan?
EDDIE: This way, this way, this way.
Josh said he's in the electrical vault.
Okay. Here we are.
Got him.
Carson?
Yeah. How'd you know?
Josh let us know you're down here.
CARSON: Josh? I'm glad he remembered.
Let me guess.
Arc blast?
Yeah. The suppression blanket took the hit.
I got too close.
I crawled over here to get my phone.
Well, we're on no signal down here.
(screams) My leg really hurts.
BP is 130/80.
Little high. We're gonna give you something for the pain, Carson.
Should kick in soon.
Oh, please.
EDDIE: I'm also gonna need to cut through this pant leg.
Do what you got to do.
I gave up trying to yell for help.
What's going on up there?
BUCK: Uh, well, the building's on fire.
Well, that's not embarrassing.
Arc blast is not your fault.
This is a very old building.
Who knows what kind of faulty wiring was down here?
(grunts) Oh!
Why did I tell you to do that?
Hey, I know it looks bad, but not a lot of blood.
That's a good thing.
Oh, isn't that always a good thing?
EDDIE: (chuckles) You got me there.
How's that morphine?
Good.
Okay, we're gonna splint this and we're gonna get you out of here.
Can they fix it, or am I gonna be the next contestant on<i> So You Think You Can Sit?</i> Now, listen, I had an entire fire truck fall on my leg, and hey, look at me now.
That sounds horrible.
No, horrible was the blood clots you get after.
Mine was in my lung. I was coughing up blood.
And they put you on these blood thinners and...
Buck.
You guys should take this act on the road.
Let's get you out of here first.
BOBBY: May!
May! May, can you hear me?
(thudding) BOBBY (distant): May! May!
SHORE: Let's knock it down quick and get this area ready for extraction.
(coughing) Help is here.
Come on, it's time to go.
Josh, we're on-line down here, ready to cut the power.
<i>-Start wrapping it up up there.</i> Copy that. Wait for my signal.
All right, anyone who's ready, let's hit the stairs.
I'm not going anywhere, sir.
Linda.
I can't leave.
Elderly man went out on a walk in the Palisades.
Wandered into Will Rogers Park, can't find his way back.
Any luck on a location?
He's not near any major cell towers.
All units responding to the Westbrook Avenue section of Pacific Palisades, please report.
(explosion overhead) Linda, we got to go.
<i> ATHENA:</i> <i> 727-L-30 on scene.</i> <i> I've got the subject.</i> Terry, we're on the move.
Cut the generator.
(coughs) You can't win. It doesn't care.
So that's it.
You're just a playground bully that likes to pick on little kids to feel better about herself.
It's actually pretty pathetic.
You don't like me because I'm younger and more competent than you ever were.
And yeah, people like me, a lot.
So just lay there and die like the old dinosaur that you are.
Y-You're such a baby girl...
And you just want to die?
You want to die?
Answer me! Do you want to die?!
No.
Then move your ass.
Now!
BOBBY: Okay.
(coughing) Hey, all right.
Let's get her some O2.
All right, all right.
Breathe. You're okay. Here we go.
I got you.
BOBBY: Are you okay?
MAY: Better now.
(screams) Keep moving, keep moving!
May, don't tell your mother about that.
Okay.
(coughing) Almost out!
Go. I'll wait for Cap and May.
Han, you good?
Yeah.
All right, nice work!
Let's get out of here!
Albert!
Go, go, go!
CHIMNEY: I got you.
I got you.

I figured you were the only person you'd listen to.
(chuckles) Just make sure I get the credit.
Well, you finally earned it.
Wait, that's my dad. I want to ride with him.
You didn't have to lie.
I wasn't.
I have two dads and you're one of them.
(indistinct radio chatter) SUE: You doing okay?
Yeah.
Fine.
Cleared for duty by the paramedics.
Why don't you take five, anyway? Looks like you could use it.
You know what?
I'm gonna take you up on that.
(sniffles) Oh, wait.
Do we do background checks when we hire contractors?
Yes. They're quite extensive.
Great.
Hey.
How are you feeling?
Terrible at my job?
I think this whole thing is my fault.
Oh...
Are you kidding?
This building is... was ancient.
We were due for an upgrade.
Upgrades used to be my specialty.
There's no reason why they still can't be.
Hey.
How you doing?
Thought I lost you there for a second.
Me, too.
You know how they say your, uh, whole life flashes before your eyes?
Mine kind of sucked.
(laughs softly) Albert, I'm sorry.
Oh, it's not your fault.
No, it was.
You never should've been on that roof.
Howard, it...
You were trying to tell me something the other day, and I wasn't ready to hear it.
(sighs) You know, me and Pop have never really had a great relationship, and I know that he thinks me being a firefighter is the stupidest thing I've ever done.
It's not stupid.
You're a hero.
And you're my brother, so...
... you looking up to me, wanting to follow in my footsteps...
... it meant the world to me, you know?
That's actually why I didn't want to disappoint you so badly.
Just wish I could be half as good at this as you are.
Hey, listen.
Don't settle for being half of anything, okay?
Go out there and be something that allows you to be a hundred percent you.
What are you saying?
I'm saying I love you.
And I want you to quit.
If that's what you want.
(laughs) (exhales) This is silly. I feel like I just pulled something.
We will let the MRI confirm that.
Don't need an MRI, just need some ibuprofen.
Is he kidding right now?
No.
He is a terrible patient.
Look, you are getting that MRI, even if I have to throw you in the machine kicking and screaming.
Listen, Sergeant... (grunts) All right, all right. I won't be doing any kicking.
Exactly. A roof fell on you.
I am fine. This is not a big deal.
It was to me.
You saved my life.
So please, get the damn MRI.
Okay.
Well, this is what I get for disobeying your orders.
You did tell me not to go down there.
I'm so glad you did, Papa Bear.
Lucy Donato.
I'm Taylor...
Taylor Kelly.
Yeah. Heard a lot about you.
Same.
Uh, did you want a comment?
You don't know what the 118 means to him.
I know all firefighters, they live together and work together and...
probably do feel like a family some of the time.
But for Buck, that firehouse is his family.
When things gets messy at the 118, he falls apart.
I'd hate for things to get messy again.
She's a peach.
Hey, so, uh, he-he-- he's good, right?
He had some pain in his leg on the way in.
Might be a pinched nerve.
Mm.
Well, with all that he's been through, he's lucky that's all that it is.
Yeah, I think a lot of people got lucky today.
JONAH: Coming through!
Come on! Come on. Come on.
Give me something.
Decompressions.
Wh...
JONAH: I got her.
HEN: Jonah!
You're gonna make it!
Jonah.
She coded in the ambulance.
DOCTOR: What happened?
Patient suffered cardiac arrest en route. No pulse.
How long has she been down?
12 minutes.
DOCTOR: Let's call it.
(panting) Jonah, what happened?
She was fine when I left triage.
Pressure bottomed out.
Couldn't get her rhythm back.
It's weird.
I should've been able to save her.
I usually save them.
Hen.
She was fine. I-I don't understand.
Neither do I.
<i> It was weird.</i> It was weird, or he was weird?
"I should have been able to save her." That's what he said.
Like she was a math problem or...
a missed point in a tennis match and-and not a human being.
Well, maybe that's just how he packs it away.
There's packing away and there's throwing away.
Look, you always say that when you're out there, all you've got is your instincts.
And truth is, you've never liked the guy.
So maybe there's a reason why.
I think there is.
