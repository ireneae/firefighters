I, uh, I forgot my phone.
Chimney still not texting you back?
Uh, no, he, he did.
That's great. What'd he say?
"Stop texting me, Buckley." Well, that's progress?
I haven't heard from Maddie since I told her about Chimney leaving.
I guess no one is speaking to me.
That's two people.
Not quite everyone.
No, it's, uh, it's weird at work, too.
Weird how?
Everyone missing Chimney?
It's like no one is even talking about him.
You know, they're just avoiding the subject.
Avoiding me.
Hen is being weird, Eddie's being weird.
Everything is just off.
You think they blame me for him leaving town?
Probably not as much as you do.
You know, my first boss when I moved to ♪. A.
was a real hard-ass.
This is how she'd look at me.
All the time.
Like she was angry.
She did it every time she came into the newsroom.
And I was so self-conscious.
Then she'd turn and leave in a huff.
Okay, so, so, what did you do to-to make it right?
Nothing.
Someone else did.
A surgeon. She had gallstones.
That's why she kept scowling at me.
She was in pain.
So maybe you might want to consider that not everything is about you.
Yeah.

Buck, Eddie is with Hen so you and Ravi grab the forcible entry tools.
Follow my lead and try not to step on my toes.
Lucky for you I'm an excellent dancer.
Same goes for you, probie.
LAFD. We got a call from this address.
For security reasons, most residential doors open inwards, which is why the hinges aren't on the outside and you can't just saw them off.
Come on.
Why don't you do the honors.
Craig? LAFD here.
Help me. Oh.
Uh, nice swing.
I have some notes.
All right, sir, we're here.
I can't move.
Okay, did-did you hurt your head or your neck in any way?
No.
We're gonna help you sit up so that you can breathe a little easier.
What are you doing?
Getting into position to lift the patient.
On my side?
Okay.
Let's get him upright and relieve the pressure on his diaphragm.
I'm just gonna...
Stabilize your neck.
Did I have a stroke or something?
Based on the lack of facial drooping, your speech, there's no impairment, I'd rule that out.
Then why can't I move?
I'm gonna try to figure that out.
No sign of trauma.
Airways patent.
Pulse feels strong.
BP's 110/70.
Oxygen is 93.
I'm gonna lift your arm for you, and then you keep it raised as long as you can after I let it go.
 Okay?
 Okay.
Oh, God, what's happening to me?
I'm gonna test your nerve response.
Do you feel any pressure?
So much pressure.
I just wanted to get fit like everybody else, but I never thought it would kill me.
N-No, like pressure from my touch.
Oh. Yeah, I can feel that.
Craig, have you been working out a lot? Is this something new?
I-I just got the Narcissus.
The exercise mirror out there.
There's a mirror called Narcissus?
Feels like someone didn't read to the end of that story.
<i>Battering ram</i> positively must be returned to the bottom compartment, handle facing outwards.
That way, you can open the door with one hand and grab the ram with the other in one fluid motion, like so.
This motorized gurney is awesome.
The B shift guys never let me use it.
It's 'cause it's not a toy. Stop playing with it.
Probie, I said stop playing with...!
What did you do?
<i>BOBBY Where's that gurney, Buck?</i> Uh... small technical issue with that, Cap.
<i>What kind of issue?</i> Uh, bringing in the stair chair ASAP.
Keep your hands to yourself.
<i>300 sit-ups?</i> <i>Is that too much?</i> Yeah, I-I'd call that excessive.
What we have here is a severely pinched nerve in the neck, from overexertion and straining, which caused his body to spasm and freeze.
That's why you can't move.
But I assure you, it's all temporary.
Let's push ten milligrams of morphine to relax his muscles en route to the ER.
Running a line.
Go for it.
Wheels could probably use some WD-40 when we get back to the station.
Have you seen these workout mirrors?
So crazy.
 Stay focused.
 Super crazy.
You get distracted and people die.
I'm gonna die.
No, you're gonna take it easy, okay?
No more crazy workouts trying to fit in.
Just do you.
I've definitely learned my lesson.
Wow. You guys are pretty jacked.
What kind of workout do you do?
I give up.
<i>Harry still acting weird?</i> Barely says a word.
Have you talked to him?
I was hoping he might open up to you.
So mother-daughter mani-pedi day was a bribe.
 You're fishing.
 Well, have you? Talked to him?
Oh, hell no.
Oh, sorry. Linda asked me to cover her shift.
That would be a no.
Now that you got rent to pay, I would think an extra shift here and there is a good thing.
Well, it normally would be, but Claudette will be working.
Hard pass.
Oh. New dispatcher?
A transfer. Everyone loves her.
And you don't.
Honestly, I think it's the other way around.
I don't think she likes me very much.
Impossible.
What's not to like?
I know.
She's always giving me a hard time.
Constantly.
Wait a second.
This woman is picking on you?
No.
Kinda, but it's fine.
Oh, no, it's not fine.
How long has this been going on?
I don't know, couple weeks.
A grown woman has been harassing you at work for weeks now, and I'm just now hearing about it?
Why are neither of my children talking to me?
Do I need to come down there and have a word with Miss Claudette?
That's another hard pass.
She already thinks I'm a child, so having my mommy come stick up for me isn't going to help.
Okay, fine.
But just say the word. You know I always got your back.
Mm-hmm.
Now... about Harry.
<i>Thank you for coming down, Mr. Grant.</i> <i>It's Nash. I'm his stepfather.</i> Ah. Our files have been a mess since the cyberattacks.
We had Harry give us a parent's phone number, and we never...
Ah. He had you call me.
Okay, so what did he do?
I want to be clear.
We're all very sensitive to the fact that Harry has been through a significant trauma.
We've done our best to be patient, but his acting out has reached the point...
 Acting out?
 He has been ill-tempered.
Not turning in his homework, using expletives with his teachers.
But now we have moved past the point of understanding, and we need to take action.
Harry is being suspended one week.
One week for being ill-tempered?
Not exactly.
You're mad.
I am surprised.
The Harry that principal was talking about is not the Harry that I know.
Cursing, talking back and now punching another kid?
He's a jackhole.
Well, Harry, I think your parents are gonna want a better explanation than that.
I think you might want to reconsider the language.
Do they have to know about this?
Harry, we're pals, but you got suspended.
I think your father's gonna notice when you don't go to school tomorrow.
Well, can't I just stay at the firehouse?
 It's just for a week.
 No.
And I know that's why you got them to call me because you thought you could get me to cover for you.
They just don't get me.
Not like you.
Yeah, that's not gonna work either.
So you're gonna tell them?
No, you are.
♪ What are you doing?
Um, I was just checking my lipstick before I started work.
911. What's your damage?
<i>Okay.</i> We got a long list today.
First we'll head west towards the walnut trees.
They're way overgrown.
That list looks more like a novel.
 Maybe we should split up.
 Nah.
A lot of these are two-man jobs.
Well, 'cause one of the men is old.
It's gonna be blazing hot today, and I'd rather not risk my delicate skin because you need someone holding your hand while trimming some bushes.
Did you just call me old?
No.
Your birth certificate does that already.
I mean, I got no trouble working alone.
I know what I'm doing. Don't you?
I don't think the boss would like if we...
We each take an even share, and if you finish yours before I finish mine, I'll clean the carts.
You might need a nap by then.
Fine.
As long as we get the job done.
Just be real careful trimming those high branches!
Can't hear you!
I'm too busy winning!
Can you speak?
If there's any way you can speak.
They're on a cell phone.
See if you can get their GPS coordinates.
We're trying to get your location now.
Please don't hang up.
We're pinging your phone to see if we can get a more exact location.
Griffith Park recreation area.
We have you in the general vicinity of Crystal Springs Drive.
Can you tell me the nature of your emergency?
You don't have to speak; Just try to touch one of the numbers on your phone if you can hear me.
Okay.
Touch a button if the answer is yes.
Do you need police?
Do you need medical assistance?
<i>Are you injured?</i> Truck 118 with rescue, respond to Griffith Park, Crystal Springs Drive.
Unknown individual in need of medical aid.
Unknown injury. <i>118 en route.</i> <i>Do you have a more specific location?</i> Copy, 118. Working on it.
Fire and paramedics are on the way.
Can you still hear me?
Hello.
<i>118, still have an open cellular line.</i> Just hearing faint sounds of traffic <i>and a semi-truck's horn.</i> <i>Distant but not that distant.</i> Subject is possibly near the I-5 freeway.
<i>Dispatch, 118 on scene.</i> Are we sure about this?
118, it did not sound like a prank.
They're out there.
<i>All right, let's spread out and search.</i> LAFD!
Can you hear us?
 Fire Department!
 Fire Department!
LAFD! Anyone out here?
Anybody see anything?
 Nothing, Cap!
 Sorry, Cap!
<i>- Nothing here!</i>  Wait, wh-who said that?
<i>Who said, "Sorry, Cap"?</i> <i>Firefighter Diaz.</i> I didn't say that in the radio.
<i>Yeah, but I heard it anyway, on the victim's phone.</i> Everybody, with Eddie.
Everybody, with Eddie!
Got a visual!
<i>- Dispatch, we found him.-</i>  Okay.
Oh, God.
Chain saw must've hit a knot to cause it to kick back so hard.
Wedged it into his collarbone.
Okay, dispatch, patient located.
<i>E couldn't speak because he hadH chain saw blade in his throat. a.</i> Buck, Ravi, we're gonna need to remove  that blade from the motor.
 Oh, I-I don't think...
Probie, if you're gonna vomit, do it somewhere else.
Copy.
Alive. Barely.
His heart rate's elevated.
Blade must've nicked his carotid, but at least it's giving us just enough pressure to prevent him from bleeding out immediately.
Okay, I'm gonna bolus a liter of normal saline.
Okay, Buck, I've got the weight.
You got the disassemble when you're done there.
BP's dropping, 90/60.
He doesn't have very long.
 Set?
 He got it.
All right, good to go!
Oh, my God!
Is he alive? Yeah. And stable.
The chain saw did a number on his neck, though.
I knew we shouldn't have split up.
I can't believe I let him get to me.
Don't worry. We're gonna take good care of him.
And we're gonna drive very carefully.
<i>118 in transport.</i> <i>Victim is still alive.</i> Hallelujah.
There's no shame in asking for help.
Better than letting someone die on your watch.
It was humiliating.
She just walked over, plugged herself into my call and took it over.
Well, did she save the guy?
Not the point.
I could've saved him if she'd let me do my job.
But she didn't even give me the chance.
You just need to learn how to stand your ground.
Bullies don't back down unless you make them.
The only reason she's dishing it out is because she knows you'll take it.
I don't think I should be taking advice from someone who got suspended from school.
Harry, did you tell Mom and Dad  you were coming over here?
 No. Why?
There something you forgot to tell your parents?
I can't believe you told them.
I wouldn't have had to if you told them yourself  like we agreed.
 Harry, you just can't take off like that.
Not after...
We were worried sick about you, man.
A-And you.
You don't call us to tell us that he's here?
I didn't know he was on the I am.
I didn't say anything because I knew you guys were just gonna get mad.
No one's getting mad.
We just want to know what happened.
Why did you hit someone?
Yeah, is something going on at that school?
 With this boy?
 We know you're going through a lot, but you got to talk to us.
Let us help you.
I don't really want to talk to either of you.
 Hey, Harry.
 What? You want me to be honest, right?
Yeah, but I don't want you to be disrespectful.
Fine. Sorry. Are we done?
No, we're not.
After everything you've been through...
I only went through anything because of you two!
 Dad just stood there and let it happen.
 What?
And Jeffery was only there because of you.
But you were too busy being a cop.
Too busy to protect me.
 Harry, that's not fair.
 But it's true.
Because that's what she cares about.
Being a cop.
Jeffery was right about you.
You're a terrible mother. Hey.
Harry.
I can't believe he said that.
To be clear, I think that was Jeffery talking, not Harry.
He looked at me like... I was some kind of monster.
Maybe I am.
I hit him, Bobby.
Yeah, you did.
The way he kept saying Jeffery's name, like they were friends or something.
What did that man do to my son?
I think we just need to give him time to heal.
We can't push him.
I have given that man enough time  and enough of my life.
 Yeah.
It's not about Jeffery anymore. It's about Harry now.
That bastard is dead, and he's still wreaking havoc on my family.
Don't let him live inside your head.
It's hard not to.
Especially when it feels like he's winning.
Probie!
Hen, have you seen the probie?
So this is what it's come to?
He gets a little queasy at a scene, and now it's off with his head?
No. I just want to show him how to disassemble one of these.
 Ah.
 Well, if you see him, let him know I'm looking for him.
 Mm-hmm.
 Probie!
Anybody home?
Okay.
Oh. Hey.
Thought I might find you hiding in here.
Hiding? No. Not at all.
 I finished everything on Buck's checklist.
 Mm-hmm.
So I, you know, started thinking maybe I could earn some extra credit.
So I, uh, came in here and, oh, started tightening the screws on Cap's old desk chair.
Mm.
Okay, fine.
I was hiding from Buck.
I needed a break.
Please don't tell him I'm in here.
Don't worry.
I'll protect you from Buck and his chain saw.
There's a chain saw?
Oh, I think he would call it a teaching tool.
It's just, in the beginning, he seemed so nice.
And now he's like a drill sergeant from hell.
Look.
Buck is going through a lot.
He feels like one of his families has slipped away from him.
So now he's hyper-focused to protect the other one.
The 118.
He's teaching you to make sure that you're ready.
But, because he's Buck, he also wants to make sure that you're worthy.
Do you think I am?
I do.
So don't let him get into your head.
If he pushes too far, push back.

Come on, I'm doing a bit here.
Oh, that's adorable.
Oh, this?
Oh, this is my new everyday piece.
Everyday?
You're kidding me. It's amazing.
It's a impulse buy.
It's just stunning.
You know, darling, it reminds me of the one we've been looking at.
We've been looking at one?
The bangle, silly.
Oh! Oh, yeah, the bangle.
Which bangle?
Uh, the white gold Cartier with the pavé diamonds  all around.
 Oh.
You said you were gonna get it for me for our anniversary.
It's our 51st. Not a huge year.
We do not need a special occasion.
A bangle is a staple.
Oh, yeah, the staple argument.
I love that one.
Guess I'm buying a bangle.
Mm-hmm.
Are you doing a bit again, Felix?
Mm-mm. Lewis, could you, um, check out the basement?
People have been complaining about a foul odor coming from down there.
I didn't even know we had a basement.
Did you, Felix?
I wonder what's down there.
Just a lot of storage. And a chapel.
Oh, a chapel? Really?
I wonder what that's like.
Don't you, Felix?
Oh. Every day.
Uh, so, Beverly, did they say what the foul odor smelled like?
Uh, chemical-like, but foul.
Oh, careful, Felix.
That's a lot of steps.
Lewis, go with him, please.
Ah, hell.
I got this, kid.
Felix, what did you do?
All right, folks, dispatch said the fire started with an explosion inside the chapel, basement level, bravo side of the building.
Chapel?
Someone piss off the big guy?
No word on point of origin.
Buck, Ravi, you guys are in the lead.
Run a fire hose through the front door and start knocking it down.
Probie, wrong hose.
Inch and three quarter.
 I'm Beverly. I'm the manager.
 How many unaccounted for?
We're confirming, but as far as I can tell, two.
Lewis is one of my orderlies and Felix is one of the tenants.
How old is Felix?
I want to say 79.
He was not supposed to be down there, but he insisted.
 Insisted? Why?
 I wish I knew.
We'll get them both out of there. Don't you worry.
All right, let's go.
Cap, we got a live one over here!
Copy that.
You must be Lewis.
Probie, stay with me!
Nozzles on now!
Cap, let's get the door.
All right, on three, Eddie. One, two, three.
I got this!
 Are you sure?
 Yes.
Just get me an assist, go find Felix.
Easy, easy, easy. 118, we need a gurney in the basement level.
<i>On our way, Cap.</i> Easy, Lewis. Best if we let the surgeons at the hospital take that out.
Cap!
Hey, Felix, is that you? Can you hear me?
Let me get this on you, and then we're gonna move this pew and get some morphine in you.
All right.
I think his hip is shattered.
All right, we set?
On three. One, two, three.
You're doing great. You're doing great, Lewis.
You're doing great.
All right.
Oh! No, no!
Now, uh, not-not so great.
It's all right.
We're all all right.
I need you to hold pressure.
That fire is spreading again.
More water, probie!
What the hell?!
Let's go, Eddie.
Can't move him until I tie this off.
He could bleed internally.
Come on, probie! More water!
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
These chemicals are reacting to water.
We need CO2.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Probie, wait up!
Let's go, go, go, go!
Hen, looks like we've got a potential second fire starting here; You need to clear out.
Let's go.
Almost there, Cap.
Where's that CO2?!
Okay, I got it, Cap! That's it!
 Let's go!
 All right.
Panikkar!
Take over for me here, Panikkar!
Got it?
 Yeah, got it.
 All right.
What is it, Cap?
This is somebody's idea of retirement.
There he is!
 He's alive!
 Oh.
Oh, thank God.
Felix, are you all right, sweetheart?
I feel great.
That could be the morphine talking, ma'am.
Dispatch, this site is now a crime scene.
Looks like we just uncovered a meth lab.
How else could I afford a bangle?
And a diamond-encrusted one, no less.
F-F-Felix. It...
It must-must be the morphine talking.
Or-or he's doing a bit. Are you doing a bit?
Nothing but the best for my Fiona.
Actually, only the best for Marcia, because that's who you were always trying to beat.
Hey, fellas.
This is Marcia and Herman Jones, by the way.
We spent our entire adult lives trying to keep up with the actual Joneses.
Show 'em the bracelet, guys.
Anything you'd like to add, ma'am?
It's not all about the bangles and the diamonds.
It's this place!
Do you know how much leisure living actually costs?
I had no choice but to turn to a life of crime.
Well, looks like you should've chosen something a little less explosive.
Ha.
Hey, probie.
What'd I do now?
You saved the day with that CO2 call.
Congratulations.
I think you're ready.
<i>Hey, you've reached the voice mail</i> <i>of Maddie Kendall. Leave a message.</i> Hey, Maddie, it's, uh, it's me.
<i>The mailbox is full and not accepting new messages.</i> <i>Hey, it's Chimney.</i> <i>Sorry I can't talk right now.</i> <i>Nless it's Buck, in which case,  U top calling me. s.</i> Probie! Where are you?
Buck.
It's dinnertime. Let's go.
I thought we were having Mexican tonight.
Yeah, Cap switched it up.
He didn't want to trigger me so soon after you turned my gurney into a taco.
Still can't figure out how you did it.
I didn't even know it could bend like that.
Yeah, me either.
Well, you managed to fix it.
And apparently you can now disassemble a chain saw in under a minute.
Oh, sorry. Am I in your seat or something?
No. You're good, probie.
 All right, let's eat.
 Hold on, Cap.
There's something I, uh, I wanted to say to all of you.
I've really loved being a part of the 118 these past five years.
This place and, uh, you guys mean so much to me.
Which is why, for the good of everyone, I've decided I-I'm gonna put in for a transfer.
What?
Wait, what? No, I-I know it's a lot of change, with Chimney leaving, but I really think probie...
Ravi is ready to fill the spot.
Chimney's spot?
Uh, no.
No, Eddie is replacing Chimney.
You're replacing me.
Who replaces me?
Uh, I'm sure Cap can figure that one out.
Great.
For a minute there, it seemed like we all forgot who the captain is.
 If I may...
 You're not leaving, Buck.
 And Chimney is coming back, guys. We don't know that.
What I do know is that nothing is the same without him.
E-Everything feels broken now, and it's my fault.
 I'm the reason he's gone.
 I told Chimney to leave.
He came to see me, said he wanted to find her.
I told him he should.
I told him it was the right thing to do.
And I offered to go with him.
Oh.
He's coming back, Buck.
With Maddie.
And when he does, you're gonna be right here, where you belong.
You're stuck with us.
Now, can we please eat?
You guys are so weird.
Uh, actually, sir, your dog is in violation of the leash law.

When it got really bad, I took a handful <i>of my mother's pain pills.</i> <i>But she found me in time. I got lucky.</i> <i>Because you know what?</i> I didn't want to die. Not really.
<i>And I'm not telling you things will always get better, Lisa.</i> <i>I'm telling you</i> you'll never find out if you die today.
<i>Move, move, move!</i> <i>Dispatch, this is Captain 144.</i> <i>We got her. Thanks.</i> Roger that.
 How did you know...
 You never take a bottle of pills where somebody can see you.
It was either her bedroom or the bathroom.
From the echo, I figured the bathroom.
I know I ride you pretty hard.
But it's because I can see you have the potential to be great.
Thanks.
But you ain't great yet.
So there's never a reason why you wouldn't be ready.
Because we are the first first responders.
It's on us to keep our eye on the crisis and not become one.
Excuse me.
You're in my way.

Thanks.
You, too.
Hey.
I just wanted to say I'm honored that you picked me to fill your shoes.
 Really?
 Yeah.
But I'm glad I don't have to.
I like being me.

 Oh.
Sorry I'm late.
Please come in. Have a seat.
Oh, when you called, I was kind of thrown off because I didn't think we had an appointment today.
Well, we didn't.
Dr. Nathanson was good enough to squeeze us in, so...
Michael told me about the other night.
Sounds like a very stressful incident with Harry.
Yes, it was, for everyone.
I don't think we know what to do anymore.
It just feels like nothing we say  gets through to him.
 And I don't think that hitting him will do the trick either.
 Michael.
 It's understandable that emotions are running high, which is why I think we should change course.
Try something else.
Those are the names of some very good therapists.
W-W-Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you suggesting that we take Harry to see someone else?
Because I-I really don't think a big change is...
For you.
This your doing?
We swore we'd never hit our kids.
You know, that we would wouldn't be those type of parents, you know.
Raise our kids different than the way that we were raised.
Athena, you hit Harry.
Hey.
How was your shift?
Uh, it was okay.
What's the occasion?
You.
Yes, Evan Buckley, all of this is absolutely about you.
Just you.
You, uh...
 You did this for me?
 Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
By the way, um, you were right about Chimney leaving.
No one is mad at me.
See, I told you.
Well, it turns out he, uh, he talked them all before he left, and they got to say goodbye.
I understand why Michael was worried, but sitting in that office felt like I was the criminal.
Michael should've talked to you first.
I don't know what he was thinking springing that on you.
He was thinking that he can't trust me.
That he needed a witness to our conversation.
Jeffery would be pleased to know that his plan is working even better than he ever could have imagined.
Well, now is not the time to give up.
Not on yourself and not on Harry.
Well, he wanted to break me.
He's winning, Bobby.
He doesn't get to win.
Because you're not gonna stop fighting. That is who you are.
And I'm gonna be right there fighting beside you.
He was wrong.
You love this family, and you're not gonna stop fighting for it.
He turned my own son against me.
What do I do if I can't fight that?
If I can't reach him?
You will.
Deep down, Harry knows you still love him.
He'll find his way back.
MICHAEL All right, man, let's wash up. It's time to eat.
Harry... now, man.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Harry! Now!
Hello? <i>Evan?</i> Maddie, hey.
Uh, thank God. Are-are you okay?
<i>Why is Chimney in Utah?</i> Uh, he-he left town looking for you.
Found out what happened to Jee-Yun.
<i>- I told you not...</i>  No, he-he figured it out on his own.
Wait a minute. How do you know where Chimney is?
 You talk to him? <i>- He emailed me a video.</i> <i>Jee-Yun started crawling.</i> Maddie, please just tell me where you are.
Okay? I-I can come and get you or I can send Chimney or whatever you want.
We just... we need to know that you're safe.
<i>I'm safe. I just, uh...</i> <i>I'm not ready.</i> <i>Not yet.</i> <i>Sorry, I... I got to go.</i> <i>- I love you.</i>  Uh, yeah, hey, I-I lo...
I love you, too.
Is she okay?
Yeah, I think so.
I think I know where she is.
