<i> (knocking)</i> Hi.
Hi.
Ah! I can't believe you're home.
(both exhale) You, uh, y-you seem good.
I am. Finally.
Uh, wh-where's Chim?
And-and Jee?
(both laughing) HEN: Welcome home.
I have missed you.
Missed you, too. You want a beer?
Yeah.
(door closes) Maddie not around?
We broke up.
So, we realized somewhere around St. Louis that it was over.
After everything you've been through?
CHIMNEY: All those other times we were apart, it always felt like it was outside forces.
Ex-husbands, pandemics.
This time, it feels like the call's coming from inside the house.
It's hard enough trying to keep a relationship together under the same roof.
But not speaking to each other for six months?
We grew apart.
Or we grew while we were apart, I guess.
It kind of sounds like he's punishing you for being sick.
No, that's not what's going on.
We made a mutual decision together that this is what's best for Jee.
So no one is punishing anyone.
Okay? Don't be mad at Chim.
(sighs) I mean, I do still owe him a punch in the face.
I already apologized to Buck. Everything is fine with us.
I'm ready to get back with the team.
Mm, yeah.
The team's configuration is just a little bit different than when you left.
Eddie quit?
Bobby replaced me?
You asked Taylor to move in with you?
Buck made out with the new firefighter?
(sighs) Wow.
Yep.
(exhales) You guys totally fell apart without me.
HORATIO: This is a very strongly worded release form.
VERN: Yeah, well, sharks don't mess around.
So neither do we.
Uh, uh, this section here about being "permanently maimed or physically disfigured"?
(clicking nearby) I thought I was safer in the cage than free diving.
You are.
Well, is there anything safer than the cage?
Land.
(sighs) Look, you don't have to go in.
(pen writing) Okay.
Let's get you geared up.
♪<i> Summer breeze</i> ♪ ♪<i> Makes me feel fine</i> ♪ ♪<i> Blowin' through the jasmine</i> ♪ ♪<i> In my mind</i> ♪ ♪<i> Summer breeze...</i> ♪ (breathing deeply) MAN: Fresh meat! Fresh meat!
Fresh meat. Come and get it.
All right, come and get it.
Fresh meat! Fresh meat!
(chuckling): All right, looking good, my man!
All right, very important.
This button right here, see it?
You push this button and inflate your vest, it's gonna bring you on up to the surface.
All right, but this is just a precaution.
You're only going down maybe 20 feet.
You got your guide with you the entire time.
Under no circumstance should you ever leave the cage.
All right? Big no-no, got it?
You good?
Thumbs up? Okay, all right.
Get on in there!
Let's do this. All right.

Hold her steady! I'm going in!
(muffled shouting) BOBBY: Okay, Buck, Lucy?
Help them tie off so we can board.
Uh, sorry. Excuse me.
How deep was he before he came up?
Over 100 feet. My other diver's still coming up.
He's only halfway.
Might as well just grab him now.
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?
JONAH: Pulse is weak.
Severe barotrauma.
Every blood vessel in his eye must have burst.
The mask did that. Squeezed his head like a melon.
I worked at a dive shop in Redondo.
HEN: Oh.
Ruptured eardrums.
Shouldn't be surprised.
Airway is patent, but breathing's extremely shallow.
One of his lungs is probably gone.
Would've ruptured on the way up.
(gasps) HORATIO: Can't move.
Everything hurts.
Jonah?
Push fluids and get him on O2.
Okay.
LUCY: Temporary paralysis, too.
He's got it bad, Cap.
Buck, get him prepped for medevac.
This is 118 to Air Operations.
We need medevac at San Pedro Marina.
Victim is suffering from severe decompression sickness and possibly a punctured lung.
Prep for hyperbaric oxygen treatment.
<i> PILOT:</i> <i> Roger that, Captain 118.</i> <i> We're transporting</i> <i> a trauma patient.</i> <i> Will circle back as soon as</i> <i> we unload. 15 minutes out.</i> He'll be dead before he sees the inside of a chamber.
She's not wrong.
JONAH: So what do we do?
Tag him and go grab a smoothie?
We could put him back in the water.
I could take him down, bring him back up properly.
That's too risky-- we need to get him in a chamber.
15 minutes?
We could build one faster.
Saw a diver do it once in Ensenada.
He said all you need is a good seal and a lot of compressed air.
He built his in a meat freezer.
How about a fresh fish freezer?
Buck, kill the power to the freezer.
He's gonna be in there anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes.
Could be hypothermic in ten, okay, even with the power off.
So we need to pump him full of warm fluids.
JONAH: Great call, Hen.
We could run the I. V. in with the air.
JONAH: I'll stay with him.
Take pressure readings and monitor his vitals.
Radio us if anything goes south.
(drill whirring) BOBBY: Okay.
Buck, Lucy, run 'em wide open.
(gasping) Lucy, be ready to switch out those tanks.
Okay, that's ten minutes.
<i> How are we looking, Jonah?</i> Pressure equivalent of 100 feet below.
Excellent.
<i> JONAH:</i> <i> Still hanging tight.</i> Core temperature is steady and his vitals are improving.
Copy that.
Fresh tanks here...
Firefighter Donato.
Thanks, Firefighter Buckley.
Okay, Lucy, start bringing the pressure down.
Okay.
How is he?
Swelling has reduced, BP is stabilized, normal breathing has returned.
Good.
Never lost anyone on a charter yet, don't want to start now.
Don't know what happened out there to make him freak out like that.
HORATIO: Sharks.
Phobia.
So you booked a shark encounter charter?
Immersion therapy.
I'm not sure it works like that.
They say the only thing to fear is...
Crazy people.
FRANK: So what are you afraid of?
That's a pretty open-ended question, don't you think?
I mean, I don't love going to the dentist.
I doubt the fear of having a cavity filled is why you blew up at Captain Nash the way you did.
I apologized for that.
I was upset.
Shouldn't have said what I said to him.
So why did you?
How's Christopher?
Good.
Good. He had a rough patch over the holidays, but he's doing better now.
Good.
I'm glad to hear that.
I know how much you worry about him.
(chuckles) His well-being.
Is that a bad thing now?
Not at all.
I just wonder if you worry about your own well-being.
You're a man who spends all of his time managing other people's pain.
Army medic, firefighter, father.
But not a lot of time facing your own.
An old drill sergeant of mine used to say that pain is nothing but weakness leaving the body.
You think pain is weakness?
It can be.
If you give in to it.
Can't put all your feelings in a box, Eddie.
You might think if you're strong enough that it'll hold.
But at some point, that box is gonna blow open.
And take me with it.
You and anyone else around you.
So what do I do?
Sit here and...
download you on every bad thing that's happened to me?
Could be a while.
Let's take a shortcut.
Maybe you should talk about your pain with someone who shares it.
Think about that first trauma.
And then talk to someone who can understand exactly what you've been through.
<i> TAYLOR:</i> <i> Oh, okay, well...</i> (chuckles) ... definitely not kitchen.
You know, I didn't realize you had this much stuff.
Yeah, we'll just have to cull as we unpack.
We probably have two of everything.
Including two couches.
Ah...
Uh, maybe just set it down over there for now.
Thanks.
What exactly are we gonna do with two couches?
Well, we'll get rid of one.
I'm guessing not the one they just carried in?
No.
Ah.
So...
Yeah.
Okay, I will see if anyone at the firehouse wants to... buy a couch.
Uh, maybe that new firefighter needs one.
Uh, you-you mean Lucy?
Um, yeah, I-I wouldn't... I wouldn't know.
Uh, we haven't really... interacted.
Uh, she-she's kind of a little...
A little what?
Bold.
"Bold"?
Uh, yeah, she-she-she's bold.
Um, yeah, so-so...
I don't know what her tastes are.
Huh, you know, you can just ask her.
Do you have good taste?
She says yes, you'll know she'll love it.
Good plan.
Aha.
Okay.
I'm gonna go return my keys and do a walkthrough with the landlord.
Wish me luck.
(knocking) (Jee-Yun cooing) MADDIE: Is this a bad time?
<i> CHIMNEY:</i> <i> A familiar face.</i> Finally!
Yeah, welcome back. We missed you.
Of course you did-- so many new firefighters around here, I thought I walked into the wrong house.
Well, on the plus side, I'm no longer the new guy.
They really do grow up so fast, don't they?
HEN: Oh, look who decided to stop by.
And just in time for lunch.
Is it lunchtime?
Can't wait to see what Cap's cooking.
Let's go.
This is...
not cooked.
What, do you want me to warm it up for you in the microwave?
You're saying no to my sushi?
I'm not saying no.
I'm saying, "Why?" Yeah, but for the record, I'm saying yes to whatever he doesn't want, so...
Never mind. I'll cook something for you.
I have got red snapper, flounder.
How do you feel about tilapia?
How does anyone feel about tilapia, Cap?
Yeah.
Okay, so what's up with all the fish?
You guys become pescatarians or something while I was gone?
We had a call at a fish market the other day.
And they paid you in flounder?
BOBBY: Hey.
How about a little seared salmon?
Little ginger, little lemon, little garlic?
What do you say?
Why not?
All right.
I'm glad you're back.
You seem better.
Glad you guys worked it out.
I don't have a job.
I need to find an apartment.
I used most of my savings when I left.
And Chimney used most of his chasing me.
Well, I'm sorry about the whole apartment thing.
If I would've known...
What?
If you had known that I was coming back, you wouldn't have asked your girlfriend to move in with you?
(chuckles) Hi.
(Jee-Yun cooing) Yeah, yeah.
Buck?
Uh, yeah, uh, maybe.
(laughs) Look, basically, I-I did a dumb thing.
And I wasn't sure how to tell Taylor, so instead I...
I did an even dumber thing.
Asking her to move in?
Mm-hmm. And listen, I-I do...
I do love her.
You know, and she's really been there for me with you guys gone, and I-I want to believe I asked her for the right reasons.
But?
I can't help but wonder if...
maybe I was just scared of being left again.
We are a pair.
The fugitive and the settler.
I'm always running, you're always...
Clinging.
(chuckles softly) I really did miss you.
I missed you, too.
Okay, so you said that the second dumb thing you had done was asking Taylor to move in with you.
What was the first?
("One More Heartache" by Marvin Gaye playing) ♪<i> One more heartache</i> ♪ ♪<i> I can't take it</i> ♪ ♪<i> My heart is carrying</i> <i> such a heavy load...</i> ♪ So...
that's the infamous Chimney.
What do you think?
That I should probably start packing.

I thought he'd be taller.
(cell phone keys clicking) (cell phone buzzes) What?
You keep checking that thing, like, every five minutes.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
It's just that today is the first day that Maddie will be alone with the baby in six months.
And you're scared.
That's an understatement.
(doorbell rings) Hey, I'm Perry from the pet-sitting app.
Excellent, right on time.
Looks like all those five-star reviews were pretty accurate.
Come on in.
Thanks.
Make yourself at home. I'm Oren.
I have to say I am so grateful you responded to my listing.
I've had the hardest time getting anybody to take this job.
That's weird.
House like this and the rate you're paying?
Figured people would be banging down your door.
(chuckles): Well...
So where are the little cuties? I don't see any running around.
Oh, no, they're in their cages.
Ah.
I know it sounds old-fashioned, but I am not a fan of free roaming.
Come on.
You're smart.
Crate training's important for reinforcing good behavior.
Right?
So how much playtime are your pets used to?
Well, they get plenty of recreation.
And I used to let them out more often, but the little devils kept running away.
So this is where you'll be sleeping.
This actually used to be the kennel.
But with all that downtime during the pandemic, I decided to go all out and make each one of my babies their very own state-of-the-art, climate-controlled environment.
Wow, lucky pups.

LUCY: That's a lot of webbery.
I am getting a reading.
He's still alive under there. Hen?
Okay, we need to cut him out of there to assess and treat him.

Is that what you were doing out here, Cap?
Talking to dispatch?
Nothing to do with a little undiagnosed arachnophobia?
Come on, Hen.
He's coding!
What?
What-what happened? He was just stable.
Pressure's bottoming out-- might be a reaction to the steroids.
Wouldn't that increase the pressure?
Yes, unless he was on some sort of prescription meds.

Thank you.

Yeah.

As long as it doesn't taste or smell like mackerel, I'm in.
They've been in there a really long time.

Yeah, I should go check.
Hey. Everything good?
Yeah. I changed her, fed her, put her down.
You should be good till morning.
Great.

Uh... no.
No, she didn't really get dirty today, so I didn't think... I'm sure she's fine.
Right. I-I'm sure she is, too. I-I didn't mean...
It's okay. You know what, I should go.
'Cause I have an apartment to see tonight, so...
Uh, sure you don't want to stay for dinner?
We're having mint chocolate chip.
No, thanks.
You guys have a good night.

Uh, maybe they're in the dishwasher.
Just tell me there are chopsticks in that bag.
Taylor, um...
Mm-hmm?
I kissed someone.
Wh-What?
I kissed another woman.
I mean, she kissed me, but I-I-I kissed her back.
And then, uh, I realized what a mistake I was making, and...
I stopped.
Look, I-I'm really sorry.
Oh.
I'm really, really sorry.
It didn't mean anything.
I was drunk and-and stupid.
When?
When what?
When were you drunk and stupid?
A few weeks ago.
We had that big save on the freeway, and...
and we went out to celebrate.
That... hmm, that is a day before you asked me to move in.
Was that why you asked me to move in?
No.
Hmm?
Not-not entirely.
"Not entirely." (scoffing): Oh. Oh.
Um, hey, wh-where are you going?
Oh, I have no idea.
Are you gonna come back?
Of course.
I don't have anywhere else to go.
You made sure of that.
(door slams) TRAVIS: Give me your purse.
What?
Give me your purse!
Now!
No.
Are you not seeing this?
How can I not when you're waving it around like that?
You want it?
You're gonna have to come and get it, 'cause I'm not giving it to you.
Lady, I swear I will shoot you.

Feels like the window's closing on that opportunity.
You got some kind of death wish?!

Nope.
Still not scared.
Are you?
No, this is not that difficult. I...
PAULINE: You scared yet?
RUTH: Ma'am!
Ma'am.
I-I don't know what this man has done, but I can pretty much make a guess.
He thought he could scare me.
Clearly, he misjudged you.
But, please, don't take me and this entire block with you to prove a point.

What's with the cold shower?
You caught yourself another Peeping Tom?
More creep than peep.
(whoops) He was trying to rob one of my customers at the pump.
She retaliated by dousing him with about $12 worth of premium, then turned the nozzle on herself.
High-octane baptism.
Now, that's a new one.
(Travis groaning) Well, the mystery of the nice man who asked for directions has been solved.
Did she say something to you?
Craziest thing. She apologized.
Reckless and remorseful.
Wonder what that's about.

Oh, God. Did something happen?
Is Pauline okay?
Pauline Barrett?
My sister. We live together.
I-I'm Leticia.
Sergeant Grant.
So, you don't know where she is?
She's not answering my calls or texts.
W-Was she in some kind of accident?
There was an incident at a gas station.
Oh. That's why she smelled like gasoline.
She blew through here, took a shower, then left again.
She wouldn't talk to me.
She's just not herself lately.
In what way?
(sighs) She's irritable.
Easy to set off.
Last week, we were at a grocery store.
Some guy was ahead of us in the express lane, and he had way more than 15 items.
He probably had 15 bottles of wine alone.
He counts those as one item. I know the creature.
What happened?
Pauline told him to move to another line. He wouldn't.
They started arguing, and Pauline just snapped.
Grabbed the bottles of wine and smashed them at his feet.
And this guy was big. He was getting in her face and leaning over her, and she didn't even blink.
And there haven't been any other changes in her life?
(sighs) Just her voice.
Uh, I noticed it a few weeks ago.
She started to sound raspy and hoarse.
Please, you have to find her.
I don't know what's happening with my sister, but she's not okay.
What is your location, sir?

I'm not afraid at all.
Okay. You're... fearless.
When you say it like that, it sounds like a good thing.
I mean, who'd want to be afraid?
<i> Uh, not many people.</i> Because they don't know what it feels like, <i> how empty you feel inside</i> when the fear is gone.

Almost there. <i> BOBBY: Copy that.</i> Here you go. Take a look.
HEN: That doesn't look good.
She did douse herself with gasoline.
HEN: Gasoline wouldn't do that.
Not even an allergic reaction.
Any other symptoms?
Mood swings, fits of anger.
I mean, yelling at men twice her size at the grocery store.
Oh, and her voice changed.
Her voice?
Yeah.
Wasn't raspy or hoarse before.
But, you know, maybe that's from all the yelling.
(whispers): Hey.
Cap, we are way too exposed here.
She sees us coming, and she's gonna jump.
HEN: Cap.
Yeah.
I have an idea, but I-I need to get closer.

But there's nothing.
I feel empty.

How rewarding it would be to help people for a living.
Like Howie. Like you.
Yeah, but it can still be difficult and taxing even when the outcome is good.
Yeah, I feel like I spend all day trapped inside of people's worst nightmares.
We catch them at the height of their fear and pain, and then, what, just go home?
Pack it away?
Some do. I never did.
I always carried it with me. But I always carried it alongside all of the amazing things that I got to do.
Every caller I helped with CPR, every birth I talked someone through.
Every kid I helped with their homework. (chuckles) I wish we got more homework calls.
Oh, I don't know. Math is hard.
(chuckles) Especially over the phone.
Look, the point is I think that you need both to find balance.
You make it sound so easy.
Confronting your fears and moving past them.
Yeah. We both know it's not.
(sighs) (Jee-Yun fusses) (Jee-Yun fusses) No. No!
(Jee-Yun crying) ♪ ♪ (Taylor clears throat) TAYLOR: Hey.
Uh, hey. (chuckles softly) You're back.
Are-are-are you back?
I only had one change of clothes in my car.
Tay, I-I am so sorry.
Look, I don't care that you kissed some random girl in a bar.
I'm not even sure I needed to know that.
But to ask me to move in with you and then tell me?
I know you're afraid of people leaving you, but this is...
You think I-I trapped you?
TAYLOR: Am I wrong?
I'm not sure.
Well, at least that's honest.
Hey, however it happened, I'm glad that you're here.
'Cause... Hey. Hey.
'Cause I want this to work.
Me, too.
So no more lies.
I swear.

From up here, it's kind of pretty.
Almost makes you forget you're flying through the Valley of Death.
Seriously, Mills? No one needs that.
There's guys dying back here.
I didn't name it.
All the dead guys did.

(door closes) Hey. Hey.
Hey, buddy. Are you okay?
He won't come out.
I keep calling him, but he won't answer.
Um, okay. Well, y-you just wait here.
I'm gonna go get him, okay?
Okay.
Uh, hey. Hey, Eddie. It's, uh...
It's me. Can I come in?
All right, Eddie, I-I'm gonna come in, okay?
Stay away from the door.
(grunts) Eddie?
(panting) Eddie?
(Eddie sobbing) Eddie.
Hey, hey, hey. What-what's going on?
Hey.
(sobbing): They're all dead.
BUCK: Who-who's all dead?
Everybody that I saved.
They're all dead.
(whispers): They're all dead. They're all dead.
They're all dead.
BUCK: Okay, buddy. Okay.
We're right out here.
Is he okay?
I mean, he's still scared out of his mind.
He's not the only one.
EDDIE (crying): I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare him. (sniffles) Just kind of...
lost it.
(sighs) (Eddie sniffles) Why?
I was supposed to... (sniffles) ... reach out to some of the people I served with.
Part of my therapy.
Okay. I, uh, I-I didn't know you still kept in touch with any of them.
Truth is I didn't.
I haven't talked to any of them since I moved out here.
I pulled four people out of that chopper alive.
Chief died in country a couple years later.
(sniffles) Rest of us made it home safe.
And, uh, wh-what happened to the others?
Norwahl...
died in a car crash.
Binder OD'd, and Mills...
... shot herself last August.
I pulled them out.
But I didn't save them.
So, that's why you took a baseball bat to everything you own?
I'm afraid.
Okay.
Okay. Well, what are you afraid of?
That I'm never gonna feel normal again.
