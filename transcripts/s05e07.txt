(<em>Man breathing loudly</em>)
<em>I think I'm dying.
Can you tell me your address?
I'm not anywhere. Aah, I'm bleeding. Yeah. I think I was shot.
Okay.</em>
Can you tell me your name?
<em>Edgar.</em>
Okay, Edgar. You said you didn't know where you were?
<em>Woods. Last thing I remember.</em>
Are there any landmarks around you?
Something to help narrow down your location?
<em>It's too dark. I think I'm underground.</em>
I think I'm buried alive.
(<em>Panting</em>)
(<em>Insects chirring</em>)
<strong>Man (<em>over radio</em>)</strong>: <em>118, this is Fire 1. We're looking for a needle in a haystack out here.</em>
(<em>Sirens wailing</em>)
(<em>Horn honking</em>)
All right, victim's name is Edgar Hill.
He told dispatch that he was carjacked, got shot and buried in some sort of coffin out here.
Based on the size of an average male, that box is probably 86 by 30 inches.
That's 45 feet of cubic space, most of which is taken up by Edgar.
So he's got ten minutes to an hour's worth of air left.
We don't know how long he's been underground, right?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Or which piece of ground he's under.
Cell towers can only limit the search by so much.
Let's fan out.
Hey, Cap, do we know how serious that gunshot wound is?
Blood loss may have gotten him already.
Dispatch still has him on the line.
Hopefully, they can keep him talking.
<strong>Hen</strong>: And not hyperventilating.
(<em>Edgar breathing loudly</em>)
There's not enough air in here.
You got to get me out of here.
<strong>May</strong>: <em>Edgar, stay calm.</em>
Do not tell me to stay calm.
<em>Edgar, stop.</em>
I know you're scared, but staying calm will help you stay alive.
The faster you breathe, the more oxygen you consume.
And we want you to save as much oxygen as you can <em>until they find you. You understand?</em>
Yeah. Okay, yeah.
A mystery is unfolding in the deep, dark woods at this hour, where it appears a man was shot and buried alive earlier tonight.
<em>A massive search and rescue effort is currently underway.</em>
<strong>Pilot</strong>: <em>118, be advised. Infrared penetration is not optimal at this time.</em>
Copy that, Fire 1. Keep doing what you can.
Buck, you get anything on sound detection?
Nothing, Cap.
<strong>Hen</strong>: If he's really out here, shouldn't he be able to hear us?
<strong>May</strong>: <em>Edgar, rescuers are on the scene. Are you sure you can't hear them?</em>
Can barely hear anything.
Oh, God!
Oh! Oh, this damn gunshot!
<em>I'm gonna die in a box. Stupid...</em>
Oh.
(<em>Punching</em>)
<em>...wooden...</em> (<em>Groans</em>) .. box.
(<em>Yelling</em>)
(<em>Yelling echoes faintly</em>)
(<em>Static</em>)
Cap, I got something.
What?
<em>Thought I heard a voice.</em>
Edgar, what was that?
<em>I got to...</em> (<em>Panting</em>) .. get... out!
(<em>Punching</em>)
Yes.
(<em>Yelling</em>)
Edgar, what are you doing?
Gonna break...
Oh!
<em>.. this...</em> down!
Edgar!
Tell me what's happening.
<em>No.</em>
Oh, no.
<em>It's caving in!</em> (<em>Yells</em>)
118, I think our victim's running out of time.
You got anything on your side?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: <em>We thought we might have picked</em> something up with the sound equipment, <em>but then we lost it.</em>
We're still scanning that same area.
<em>It's gone quiet.</em>
What if I gave you a sustained sound to listen for?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: <em>If Buck is right about</em> what he heard, we should be able to pinpoint his location.
<em>Yeah, I don't know if it'll be loud,</em> but it won't be very long.
<em>Copy that.</em>
This is Captain 118. Be advised.
<em>We are conducting a targeted sound sweep.</em>
Fire 1, give us five minutes of breathing room.
<em>Copy that, Captain.</em>
Everybody else, hold the work.
Radio silent until my call.
(<em>Insects chirring and trilling</em>)
(<em>Owl hoots</em>)
(<em>Crickets chirping</em>)
(<em>Creature chittering</em>)
(<em>Insects trilling</em>)
(<em>Owl hooting</em>)
(<em>Indistinct radio transmission</em>)
(<em>Quiet chatter</em>)
<strong>May</strong>: <em>Edgar, here's what I need you to do.</em>
Take a deep breath <em>and scream.
What?!</em>
Scream, Edgar! Now!
(<em>Yelling</em>)
(<em>High-pitched electronic feedback</em>)
(<em>Yelling</em>)
(<em>Faint yelling</em>)
There.
There!
(<em>Grunting</em>)
Here!
<em>Everybody, dig! Move!</em>
(<em>Excited chatter</em>)
Hey, come on! Come on!
(<em>Edgar yelling</em>)
Edgar, stay with us!
We're coming for you!
That's the box.
All right, let's get the top off.
Hey, hey.
Careful, now. Careful, guys.
Get the gurney over here.
We got him, Cap! We got him.
Dispatch, we've located and extracted the victim.
Beginning medical assessment.
Copy that, 118. He's all yours.
We've got a pulse.
Roll him on his side.
I'll clear his airway.
Found the bullet wound.
(<em>Groaning</em>)
Pulse 120 and thready.
BP 90/50. Breath sounds severely diminished bilaterally.
He's aspirated. We've probably got hypovolemic shock. While we're waiting, let's start a line.
<strong>Edgar</strong>: I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Lizzie.
(<em>Coughing</em>)
Thought your name was Julie.
<strong>Taylor</strong>: <em>We've had no official word from rescue personnel,</em> but based on radio communication, the search has been going on for well...
Oh, coming through.
...over...
Uh, it appears the man has been found.
There you see him.
First responders literally pulling him from the ground moments ago.
We do not yet have the identity nor the condition of the victim, but he does appear to be alive.
Investigators are now beginning to arrive on the scene as the next phase of this mystery begins.
(<em>Indistinct chatter</em>)
Where's Bobby?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: <em>Detective, it's good to have you back.</em>
It's good to be back. So what do we got?
Victim is on the way to the hospital.
Looks like he got shot in the back, put in a coffin and buried up here.
Coffin? I thought the victim said it was a carjacking.
That's what he told dispatch.
So carjackers that dig holes and bring coffins. That's new.
Victim say anything when you pulled him out?
He was calling out to somebody named Lizzie, saying he was sorry.
Could've been his wife or girlfriend?
Your guys did that?
No, victim did.
Tried to punch and claw his way out.
Buried alive.
Well, that's the stuff of nightmares.
<strong>May</strong>: Harry?
Didn't you hear me calling you?
No. I thought I saw...
What?
(<em>Car engine starts</em>)
Come on. I got to drop you off.
I don't want to be late for work.
You know, you jumped like you saw a ghost.
<strong>Nathanson</strong>: It's normal to be curious about him.
The man who kidnapped you.
I can't believe my dad showed you that.
You're not in trouble, Harry.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Your father's just concerned.
He's a snitch.
Well, he's a snitch who loves you.
Can you tell me what made you want to look that up?
No. I don't want to talk about it.
Not with you, and not with them. They weren't kidnapped.
None of you have any idea what that was like.
But we want to... understand what happened to you.
How is that gonna help me?
One of the ways we move past our trauma is to confront it and share it.
You're just like them.
Everybody wants me to move on, like nothing happen.
That's not what I meant.
The last thing I want is for you to pretend it didn't happen.
Because it did.
I see him sometimes.
See him where? In your dreams?
No.
I only see him when I'm awake.
<strong>Athena</strong>: <em>She called it a breakthrough.</em>
<strong>Bobby</strong>: <em>Isn't it? Harry's starting to open up.</em>
Well, to her. Not to me or Michael.
He still doesn't trust us.
Well, look, I know that it hurts, feels like Harry's shutting you out, but try to be patient. It's just gonna take a little time.
What if we're running out of time?
He barely said a word on the way back to Michael's.
And now he's visiting that damned Jeffery Hudson website.
Harry's looking for answers.
Something terrible happened to him.
He can't confront Jeffery, so he's trying to understand him.
Yeah. That's what my therapist said.
But it should be noted that neither of you are on that website with crosshairs over your face.
And the things that they wrote about me.
Aren't true.
You didn't drive that man to do anything.
Hudson made his choices, didn't care who he hurt, and that is on him, not on you.
Oh, Harry still blames me.
I mean, it just feels like the harder I try to hold on to him, the more he slips away.
<strong>Ransone</strong>: <em>It's quite a story, Mr. Hill.</em>
(<em>Exhales</em>) I know, right?
Yeah. Well, the tale is a little thin, though.
You say that a man took you hostage at gunpoint and made you drive to the woods.
But you don't remember anything that happened after he shot you.
They say trauma can screw with your memory.
You also don't remember where you were when he got in the car.
It all happened so fast. I...
I-I think I was driving home.
Okay, from where?
(<em>Sighs</em>) I don't remember.
And if I was to ask you if you got a good look at your abductor?
Never saw his face.
Right.
He had one of those things on, a...
What do you call it? A, uh... a baklava.
Balaclava?
Yeah.
Exactly.
My mind's just not all there.
Maybe we should start from the beginning, see if we can help jog your memory.
Mr. Hill. I hope you don't mind, but I'm...
Now's not a good time, Ms. Kelly.
Taylor Kelly. Channel 8 news.
(<em>Laughing</em>): Well, I'm a big fan.
Yeah.
She can stay.
<strong>Taylor</strong>: Well, that's great.
Maybe you'd like to give an on-camera statement about your ordeal.
I'm sure the public will want to hear your account of this atrocious crime.
I don't remember much.
Is your wife here? Maybe she can talk about her relief after your miraculous rescue.
Lizzie?
Mm-hmm.
<strong>Edgar</strong>: Yeah, she's not here.
Is she home?
She's on a trip. A cruise.
In Alaska.
Mm.
Girls' cruise trip thing.
Oh.
You know, communication out there can be pretty spotty.
We can call the ship. I'm sure they could track her down.
Well, reservation wasn't under her name.
She'd still be on the manifest. All passengers are.
You know, uh... I don't feel so good. Um, maybe if we could finish this later...
If you could leave a card...
<strong>Both</strong>: Of course.
(<em>Indistinct voice over P.A.</em>)
You might want to call me first, Mr. Hill. If you're in trouble, I can help you.
(<em>Door closes</em>)
That was weird, right?
His little song and dance about the wife?
No comment.
His story doesn't make any sense.
What kind of carjacker puts someone in a coffin?
Your firefighter boyfriend tell you about that?
No.
I watched your crime scene techs pull it out of a hole and put it in the back of their van.
Come on. I can help you, Detective.
You must have a theory.
Off the record?
All right, here's what I can tell you. Off the record.
I'm putting an officer on Mr. Hill's door.
No one is going in or out other than hospital staff.
Wow. You think the alleged carjacker could come back?
No. But I'm pretty sure you'll try.
Boston?
Yeah. Buck is convinced he heard the bells of the Old North Church in the background when she called.
The one-if-by-land-two-if-by-sea church?
That's the one.
<em>And the fact that there's</em> an exact replica of that church in Burbank <em>never occurred to him?
You're kidding.</em>
Where are you?
<em>Des Moines.</em>
I swear to God, Hen. If I drive <em>to the Eastern Seaboard</em> with my infant daughter, and Maddie's somewhere in the 818, I'm gonna kill Buck.
Yeah, you've already sworn to do that.
<em>Well, then, I'll bring him right to the point of death,</em> and with my not-insubstantial paramedic skills, I will revive him, and then I will kill him.
Why would Maddie be in Boston?
(<em>Jee-yun cries</em>)
<em>Well, that's where she lived with Doug after they got married.</em>
Again, I ask, why Boston?
There can't be a lot of happy memories there for her.
<em>He was in medical school.</em>
She was in nursing school. They barely saw each other.
<em>She used to tell me it was actually the happiest point in their marriage.</em>
What is everyone's obsession with revisiting the past?
<em>Why? Who else is taking you down memory lane?</em>
Eva.
She called this morning.
Wants to come by the station and talk.
<em>I don't know what would be worse. Me talking to my ex,</em> or me telling my wife I talked to my ex.
I kind of wish I was in Boston right now.
<em>Do you have any idea where you're gonna look once you get there?</em>
Not yet.
<em>I mean, there's got to be a reason Maddie's gone back to her past.</em>
Maybe she's chasing ghosts.
Or maybe I am.
(<em>Sirens wailing</em>)
<strong>May</strong>: <em>I get goosebumps just thinking about it.</em>
Buried alive.
You did a great job.
He sounded so scared, trapped, thinking he was gonna die.
You think that's how Harry felt?
Your brother wasn't buried in the woods.
No, he was walled up under some stairs. Totally different.
May, I'd really rather not relive it, if that's okay with you.
You know, we're-we're trying to put it behind us, you know, so maybe stop bringing it up?
I just don't understand why we can't talk about it.
We <em>are</em> talking about it.
Y-Your brother has his therapist.
Your mom has hers. Hell, I'm even considering talking to one.
Right, but we're not talking to each other.
Dad, we all went through it, in our own ways, but we aren't processing it together.
We're barely processing it at all.
We are all doing the best that we can.
Are we? He hasn't been back to the house.
And I can't help but notice, neither have you.
(<em>Sighs</em>) You know, that's not gonna solve the problem.
<strong>May</strong>: No, but it could be a step in the right direction.
(<em>Garbled radio transmission</em>)
You look good.
Thank you.
What do you want, Eva?
I'm leaving, Hen.
California.
You know, I've done my time, gotten clean.
It will be two years next month.
And I figure it's time for a-a fresh start.
Well, congratulations.
Safe travels.
So, two years without getting high... it's a long time to sit with your mistakes, the things you've done and the people you've hurt.
And I know I hurt you.
In ways that I don't even have the words for.
I'm one of your steps.
I owe you so much. You saved my life.
You took in my kid.
And despite everything I did to you, you never once took it out on him.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
How do you know that? Did you talk to Denny?
No. I know you.
Look.
Look, look. I'm-I'm... I'm glad that you're doing better, and-and-and I hope it continues.
But... forgiving you?
That's gonna take a minute.
I know.
(<em>Sniffles</em>)
I just appreciate you taking the time to hear me out.
If Denny ever asks about me...
Eva.
Just tell him the truth.
(<em>Inhales deeply</em>)
(<em>Exhales</em>)

Hey! How was your shift?
Weird.
Weird how?
A bus-through-a-building weird, or a-woman's-face-fell-off weird?
An Eva-walked-into-work weird.
She wanted to tell me that she was leaving town, and she was sorry for everything she had done, and she hoped that I could forgive her.
And... did you?
What? No.
I mean, I heard her out, but that's it. She-she left. I...
I didn't get the sense that there was anything more to it.
She seemed sincere.
She always does to you.
That's not fair.
Fair?
You cheated on me with her.
Or did you forget?
I didn't have to tell you this, you know.
Then why did you?
Because I don't want any more secrets.
I wanted to tell you the truth so that you would know that you can trust me, even when it comes to her.
You really think she's leaving town?
Yeah.
She-she seemed... sincere.
(<em>Inhales</em>)
And that is why I can't trust you.
(<em>Siren wailing</em>)
<strong>Woman</strong>: No! No!
Oh, God!
(<em>Woman crying</em>)
Ma'am, what's going on?
He's not breathing.
I went to get him out of the car seat, and he's...
Okay, let me see him. Yeah. I'm a paramedic. Give him to me.
Okay.
Okay. You, call 911! All right.
Here, let me see him.
Okay. Did, uh, anything happen while you were driving?
A fender bender? Did you slam on the brakes?
No, nothing like that. Uh, we went to the aquarium. He seemed fine.
I...
No pulse. Blood is fresh.
All right. Come on.
Come on, kid. You just gotta breathe.
(<em>Woman crying</em>)
Come on.
Let's go. Breathe for me.
All right!
(<em>Baby crying</em>)
<strong>Man</strong>: Boston EMS. Step aside.
Okay, uh, we got a newborn, bleeding from the nose, pulse is steady.
Breathing has returned, looking at a possible vitamin K deficiency.
Sounds like someone trained you well.
Eli.
What the hell are you doing in Boston, Howie?
Chasing ghosts. Long story.
(<em>Baby crying</em>)
<strong>Athena</strong>: <em>Hey.</em>
Heard you were back.
I missed you, too.
Also heard you caught yourself a real head-scratcher. - Mm.
Buried-alive guy.
Yeah. Bobby tell you about that?
No. Taylor Kelly.
Heard you two really got into it at the hospital.
(<em>Sighs</em>)
You posted a uni to keep her out?
I couldn't help myself. The woman's a menace.
I'm just trying to figure out how Edgar Hill ended up buried alive... and why he won't tell anyone what happened.
Uh, isn't that the police's job?
I don't think they have any idea what they're looking for.
Mm. Edgar Hill.
Carjacked, shot and buried alive.
Claims to have no memory of what happened and no idea of who might want to hurt him.
Married?
Yeah.
Lizzie. Married ten years.
Current whereabouts unknown.
He said she was on a cruise to Alaska.
Let me guess. He lied?
&quot;I'm sorry, Lizzie.&quot;
That's what he said when you pulled him out of the hole, right?
How do you know that? I didn't tell you that.
What? You think you're my only source?
<strong>Athena</strong>: Were you able to track down the coffin?
Was able to trace it to the store, but that was it.
They couldn't tell me who bought those specific boards.
Just gave me a list of everyone who made a purchase.
It's gonna take some time to run down all these.
Did learn something interesting, though.
The manager at the store said that they all knew Edgar Hill.
Apparently, he shopped there.
Well, he is a contractor, so that's not surprising.
He'd been in a lot the last couple of weeks, but, oddly, manager couldn't find any purchase records.
So he's coming into the store, but not buying anything?
You think he's visiting a friend?
<strong>Taylor</strong>: <em>The wife didn't have any friends.</em>
At least according to the neighbors.
But then, past few weeks, they started noticing a van parked down the street.
And one of them saw Lizzie getting out of it.
Could've been anyone's van. Could've been the pool guy.
Okay, never had a pool, but I'm pretty sure you don't meet with them inside their van.
You think she was having an affair.
I think there was definitely something wrong with that marriage.
<strong>Ransone</strong>: <em>He was having financial troubles.</em>
And still managed to find a way to pay for three life insurance policies on the wife.
They don't have kids.
She didn't work outside the home.
And he let the policy on himself lapse.
Lizzie was furious when she found out.
The mail carrier said they had a screaming match in the driveway.
Over life insurance?
He told her she'd never get another penny out of him, dead or alive.
She told him, money or not, she'd rather see him dead.
Still, one thing just doesn't make sense.
The Hills had two cars.
A seven-year-old sedan and a brand-new Range Rover.
Fancy car like that would make Edgar a target.
Except he claims that he was driving the sedan when he got carjacked.
But he had the keys to the SUV.
Did you check the garage at their house?
Empty. Both cars are gone.
I tried to ask Edgar about it, but he stopped talking.
Suppose the wife could have it.
Or maybe he gave it to a friend.
Someone who works at a home improvement store?
<strong>Taylor</strong>: <em>Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out.</em>
The marriage is in trouble.
Lizzie wants out until she discovers the money is gone.
Edgar's business is failing.
He's about to lose everything he has.
She's invested years into that marriage.
She is not about to walk away with nothing, or worse, half of nothing.
But Edgar still has those life insurance policies, and they're worth millions.
Just not as long as Lizzie's alive.
The house, the cars, the retirement accounts... they're worth millions.
But only if Edgar is dead.
You think it was a professional hit?
<strong>Athena</strong>: <em>The car could be a down payment</em> until the job is done.
Only one person knows for sure.
We need to find the hit man.
And then we can prove what really happened.
The wife did it.
The husband did it.
<strong>Karen</strong>: <em>You're packing.</em>
You're actually moving.
Yeah, want to see the lease for my new place in Portland?
I want to know why you keep popping up, trying to blow my life apart.
I'm not trying to blow your life apart.
What are you doing?
You're clean. You got a new life.
You're moving on. Great. Happy for you.
You didn't need to go see Hen. You could've just left town.
You wouldn't understand.
Then make me.
Hen was the first person who ever really saw me.
She said she loved me.
She told me that I mattered.
There was a time when me being clean would've made her proud.
You wanted to make her proud of you again.
Yeah, a little.
But, look, you really don't have to worry about me.
I have been worried about you since the third date.
She told me about you, and her hurt was so raw and so deep.
I didn't know whether to pull her close or run away.
Well, it seems like you made the right choice.
I remember when you called Hen to tell her that you were pregnant.
That you needed her help.
I thought, &quot;That's it.
She's going back to Eva. They're gonna be a family.&quot;
Every time you call, that's what I feel.
That I am about to lose my wife and my son.
Because all the people I love the most... belonged to you first.
(<em>Exhales</em>)
Hen is never gonna leave you.
What, because you're moving to Oregon?
'Cause Hen loves you more than me.
Name's Tom Gladden. He works at the store. He met Edgar Hill <em>in the parking lot at least half a dozen times.</em>
Ah, ex-Marine.
Looks like he ran into some trouble a few years back.
<em>Did a stint at Lompoc.</em>
Hasn't been back to work since Edgar's carjacking.
But he did use his credit card at a motel just up the coast.
Hey, listen.
<em>Can you take his photo over to the hospital?</em>
See if Edgar will identify him?
No can do.
Talked to a uni. Edgar Hill checked out of the hospital earlier this morning.
I got a car sitting on the house <em>in case he comes home.</em>
Okay, let me know if he shows up. I'm on my way to the motel.
<em>All right. Go get him, tiger.</em>
(<em>Siren wailing</em>)
(<em>Siren wailing</em>)
Detective Ransone.
You know you're a reporter, right?
Your job is to report the news, not create it.
I was gonna call you. I just wanted to make sure the subject was on the premises before you made a trip out.
Maybe get a confession on camera.
Make sure the parking lot's locked down, no one in or out.
By the way, how did you hear about this place?
Someone tipping you off?
I just did some old-fashioned investigating.
<strong>Man</strong>: <em>Detective, I got a guy here looking to deliver a pizza.</em>
All right, hold onto him.
This will all be over in a moment.
Tom Gladden!
Uh, who's Tom Gladden?
A very dangerous man whose door you were about to knock on, armed only with a microphone.
I was here to talk to Lizzie Hill.
What? No, Lizzie Hill is dead.
Her husband hired Gladden to kill her.
<strong>Woman</strong>: You don't have to be so rough!
Let's go.
Wait. That-that's...
<strong>Taylor</strong>: Lizzie Hill. She's the one who hired the hit man... to kill Edgar.
<strong>Man</strong>: <em>Got a runner!</em>
(<em>Groans</em>)
(<em>Panting</em>)
<strong>Lizzie</strong>: Edgar?
Damn you, Lizzie.
And you, too, Tom!
I'm so confused.
I'm so confused.
<strong>Taylor</strong>: <em>A shocking new development in the story of the kidnapping and attempted murder</em> of local contractor Edgar Hill.
In a bizarre turn of events, three suspects are in custody tonight, <em>including Mr. Hill himself, as well as his wife Elizabeth Hill, and Tom Gladden, an employee at a local hardware store.</em>
Okay. You want to tell me what happened?
Those two are crazy.
<em>Edgar was a regular. Came in all the time. Seemed like a nice guy. Couple of months ago, he mentioned he might have a job for me, real good pay.</em>
Told me what a terrible mistake <em>his marriage had been, that his wife was a horrible person. Gold digger, abusive.</em>
Never kept the house tidy.
Abusive how? Physically?
He did not say. I did not wish to pry.
I would never have considered taking such a job, but he was willing to pay me $100,000.
<em>And the fact that I had some financial hardships, and that she was such a terrible woman, I decided to help him out.</em>
I was tired of living in my van.
So you took the job, decided to kill Lizzie Hill.
<em>And then?
<strong>Tom</strong>: I saw her.</em>
And I knew Edgar had lied to me.
(<em>Puccini's &quot;O Mio Babbino Caro&quot; plays</em>)
<em>She was no shrew. She was... beautiful. I know this will sound crazy,</em> but I started to... feel things.
<em>I don't know if you'd call it love or not, but I knew I couldn't hurt this woman. I couldn't just walk away. I mean, Edgar could find another guy. Someone less discerning of Lizzie's nature. I had to warn her.</em>
So you told her the truth?
Every bit of it.
And what'd she say?
<strong>Lizzie</strong>: <em>Where the hell was he getting $100,000?</em>
He's been crying poverty for months and then, suddenly, he has the cash to hire a guy to kill me?
I wanted to know what the hell was going on.
<strong>Edgar</strong>: <em>Tom called me</em> out of the blue, said we had to meet.
<em>Starts going off about money, how he can't do the job unless I'm willing to pay him his fee up front. I offered him a grand. He refused.</em>
<strong>Tom</strong>: <em>I would like it noted for the record that,</em> up until this time, I had not yet committed a crime.
<strong>Edgar</strong>: <em>Tom took my car, so when I said I was carjacked, it wasn't completely a lie.</em>
<strong>Tom</strong>: <em>I told Lizzie what Edgar told me. That he didn't have the money yet, and he was gonna pay me once he collected the life insurance.</em>
What is he talking about?!
She was not happy.
So she decided to turn the tables on her husband then, <em>have you kill him instead.</em>
It was self-defense.
He was gonna kill me if I didn't kill him first.
And how were you gonna pay him?
(<em>Puccini's &quot;O Mio Babbino Caro&quot; plays</em>)
It was not my finest hour.
<strong>Edgar</strong>: <em>Two days later, Tom calls me.</em>
Says she's dead.
<em>I say &quot;Great. Show me some proof.&quot; But he doesn't want to send photos. Says it has to be in person. So I drove out to meet him.</em>
She's over here.
<strong>Edgar</strong>: <em>He, uh, took me to this grave in the woods. But when I looked inside, it was empty. That's the last thing I remember.</em>
Is it done?
Oh.
Oh. I hope he rots in hell.
I plead extreme emotional disturbance.
<strong>Tom</strong>: <em>When we found out that Edgar wasn't dead, we panicked.</em>
Thought it was best to get out of town, figure out what to do next.
Still don't know how Edgar found us.
There's an app for that.
Now you sure you want to confess to everything without a lawyer present?
I think I'll be safer in prison.
(<em>Sighs heavily</em>)
You sure this is okay?
Jee-Yun will be fine without you for an hour.
And Molly seemed excited about fussing over a baby she can give back before it turns into a resentful teenager.
(<em>Laughs</em>)
Though if she starts talking about having another one, I'm never speaking to you again.
I'm glad to see you doing well.
You seem happy.
You don't.
Still trying to carry the world's problems on your shoulders?
Well, Maddie's been gone a month.
And here I am on her trail like freaking Columbo.
(<em>Laughs</em>)
Driving across the country.
Letting my kid have important milestones in motel rooms.
I'd say she won't hold it against you, but eventually, they hold everything against you.
(<em>Laughs</em>)
You know Maddie leaving wasn't your fault, right?
I know that she was depressed.
I don't know how bad it was, but...
Maybe she didn't want you to know.
Or maybe I didn't want to see it.
She was struggling.
And I felt like there wasn't anything I could do other than drive her to her appointments or remind her to take her pills.
So whenever she would tell me she was okay, I'd let myself believe it 'cause it was easier that way.
For me.
You know, so I could go to work, put on a happy face, not be filled with terror every freaking moment.
It was great for me, not so good for her.
Look, you screwed up.
I mean, you did, right?
Yeah.
And you're about to do it again.
Maddie's got this voice inside her head whispering lies right now.
Telling her she's worthless, that she's a burden.
That everybody she loves would be better off without her.
I know.
So how do you think she's gonna feel when you show up on her doorstep, looking like a man who's just been on a month-long bender?
You're gonna confirm every terrible, dark thought she's ever had, and the cycle of blaming each other... it's gonna continue, and you two are gonna spiral further and further apart.
I can't give up.
No. No.
You can take a minute, or you can take a breath.
You can pull <em>yourself</em> together.
So that eventually, when you do find her, you can be the Howie that she needs.
You know, it's funny. Almost no one calls me &quot;Howie&quot; anymore.

(<em>Sighs</em>) It never stops, does it?
Always another story.
Yup, that's kind of the way the news works.
Since when does reporting the news include randomly confronting a killer?
Finding the truth can be risky... dangerous, even... but it's important.
People need to know what's going on around them.
That's my job.
Why is it your job to take those kinds of risks?
I know. Pot meet kettle, but, uh... but still.
A husband wants to kill his wife.
The wife wants to kill her husband.
How-how is that worth your time, much less your life?
The truth is worth everything, Buck. Everything.
What does that mean?
I don't know. I just...
I guess, uh, unsolved mysteries just never sat right with me.
Hey. How you doing?
They don't think it's broken, it's just dislocated.
Glad to hear it.
You'll be as good as new in no time.
Detective Ransone?
Yeah?
You ever see him? Jeffery?
Every time I close my eyes.
He was in my house.
In mine, too. Eating my food, wearing my clothes.
I know he's dead, but still kind of feels like he's there, you know?
I just... I just wish I could forget about him.
Then maybe I could move on like everybody wants me to.
You know, Harry, I've been doing this a long time.
I've spoken to a lot of survivors, and they all tell me the same thing.
You never quite really move on. <em>I mean, you heal.</em>
You know, you move forward, but <em>the trauma comes with you.</em>
You just learn to live with it.
Thought if I came here, to the place where he took me, then I could stop thinking about him.
