We all make mistakes.
The thing is, that gunman... shouldn't have been alive.
He'd OD'd multiple times.
But you firefighters...
You so-called heroes...
You kept saving him!
That's the job.
You saved his life so he could go ruin someone else's!

We don't choose who lives or dies.
We save everyone we can.
<strong>Ethan</strong>: You don't have to make the tough choices.
But people love you for it, and hate guys like me.
Chief, be advised, I have eyes on the suspect.
<strong>Pate</strong>: <em>Do you have a clean shot?</em>
<strong>Sniper</strong>: Negative. Target red.
<strong>Ethan</strong>: <em>You think saving lives</em> is a hard job?
Try having to take them.
(<em>gunshots</em>)
Athena?
(<em>grunts</em>)
This is Athena Grant.
Suspect is down.
Need medical assistance.
Captain Nash has been shot.
Athena, how did you...
I'm here.
I got you.

(<em>monitor beeping steadily</em>)
(<em>Bobby sighs</em>)
Hey.
(<em>sighs</em>)
Welcome back.
Ethan?
He didn't make it.
Once we arrested Malone, Ethan knew it was just a matter of time before we figured out he was the real sniper.
You went into a burning building.
I didn't imagine that part, right?
You actually walked through fire.
Well... you were inside.
I wasn't gonna let a little fire stop me.
I needed to get my partner back.
Thanks for coming to get me.
Always.
(<em>knocking</em>)
You are not dead.
And you came back.
Uh, wasn't sure that was gonna happen.
Yeah.
I kind of ran away.
Yeah, I noticed.
You didn't chase after me.
(<em>chuckles</em>)
Listen, I, uh...
I spent a long time feeling like I wasn't enough.
And I don't want to do that anymore.
So if you don't want me...
I do.
I really do.
Are you napping without me?
I quit my job.
What?
Did something happen?
Are you okay?
No, I'm not okay.
I'm not okay in here.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
I need help.
Okay.
I'll get you help, whatever it is.
(<em>crying quietly</em>)
We'll get you help, okay?
(<em>sniffling</em>)
Uh-oh. I think I forgot the juice boxes.
Denny might have a meltdown.
My sweet baby? He would never.
(<em>laughs</em>)
Oh, you are such a grandmother.
You have no idea.
No.
Mommy Karen!
Mommy Hen!
Oh!
Nia!
What? What are you...
<strong>Evangeline</strong>: Nia.
Nia?
<strong>Nia</strong>: It's Mommy Hen and Mommy Karen.
Hi!
Nia.
Nia, we should go.
Grammy!
Hi, precious.
Look at you.
You are getting so big!
Your mommy must be feeding you well.
Where's big brother?
Hey, Nia!
Jungle gym.
Jungle...
Don't worry.
I got her.
Um... I'm-I'm Hen, and this is my wife Karen.
Nia's foster parents.
This is awkward.
I don't know what the rules are.
I... I don't think there are any.
I've thought so much about you.
About the things I wished I could say to you.
But now I don't...
How about we start with lunch?
We were just about to sit down to a little picnic.
<strong>Hen</strong>: Yeah, there's plenty.
Grammy doesn't know about portion control.
(<em>chuckles softly</em>)
That'd be nice.
Thank you.
That's the thing I wanted to say.
Thank you.
Come on.
<strong>Buck</strong>: Okay, uh, nurse is getting your meds and discharge papers ready.
Then we can get out of here.
Great.
Hey, since we got a minute...
Uh, is everything all right?
Yeah, yeah, I'm just, uh, I've been meaning to talk to you about something.
Okay.
So, you might have noticed I almost died.
Again.
Yeah, I've had a lot of close calls.
This one wasn't even my closest.
Yeah. Eddie...
Just let me finish.
After the last time, when that well collapsed on top of me...
Which you survived.
(<em>chuckles softly</em>)
After that... it got me thinking.
You know, what would happen to Christopher if I hadn't?
So I went to my attorney and changed my will.
So, someday, if, I, uh... didn't make it...
Christopher would be taken care of.
By you.
What?
It's in my will, if I die, you become Christopher's legal guardian.
Uh...
I mean, h-how-how does that even work? Don't you...
(<em>laughs</em>)
Don't-don't you need my consent?
My attorney said you could refuse.
You know I wouldn't.
Nah, I know you wouldn't.
I mean, he-he has grandparents, other family.
(<em>chuckles</em>)
Yeah.
After Shannon left, they all tried to guilt me into giving Christopher to them.
It's not what I wanted then, it's not what I want now.
If it came to that, w-wouldn't they fight for him?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Probably.
But no one will ever fight for my son as hard as you.
That is what I want for him.
Well, you said you did this last year.
Why are just telling me now?
Because, Evan, you came in here the other day and you said you thought it would have been better if it had been you who was shot.
You act like you're expendable.
(<em>sighs</em>)
But you're wrong.
