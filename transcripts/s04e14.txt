All you got to do is hang on.
Push through the pain.

<i>Shots fired. Shots fired!</i> <i>Firefighter's been shot!</i> Shots fired!
Get down!
We need LAPD and air support!
Firefighter needs help!
Come on, Eddie!
Stay down! I'm gonna come! I got you!
Stay down!
Shots fired. Firefighter needs help!
Eddie, hang on. Eddie...
Firefighter needs help. I repeat...
I got...
Aah!
Get him in the cabin!
Come on.
Get him in the cabin!
Get to the trucks!
Go! Go, go, go, go!
Hey, come on!
Back up! Back up, back up, back up!
Here, we got you. We got you. Hey, hey.
I got you. Okay.
This is the captain of the 133 en route to Byrne Memorial.
Hey, just...you just stay with me, okay?
Requesting a trauma unit to meet us.
Hey...are you hurt?
We have a firefighter with a gunshot wound.
Firefighter Eddie Diaz No, no, no. I'm good.
of the 118.
You just hang on.
Hey, come on! Come on!
Just hang on.
Hey, three minutes away. You're so close.
We're gonna need a lot of blood.
We're so close, I just...
I need you to hang...
I need you to hang on.
Where are you going?
To work. I'm late.
Absolutely not. You don't get to announce our marriage isn't working and then just walk away, Bobby.
Hen, what's up? I'm on my way. <i>-Cap, it's Eddie. He's been shot.</i> <i>They're transporting him now.</i> What hospital?
Come on! Come on, come on!
Through-and-through. Upper torso. Copy that.
Large caliber.
We've got a transfusion ready.
Did you say large caliber?
It was a sniper.
Pulse is weak.
Trauma Bay Two. Let's set up for a thoracotomy.
You okay, Buckley?
No.
Right this way.
Appreciate it.
Detective Denvers?
Sergeant Athena Grant. Heard about the shooting.
Thought I'd stop by, see if I could help.
And why would an off-duty sergeant be interested in my crime scene?
My husband's truck.
He's captain of the 118.
Injured man was one of his.
What do you know about the wounded firefighter?
Someone said he was ex-military.
Eddie. You think he was the intended victim?
He was the first one shot.
By someone who's apparently a very well-trained sniper.
Feels like there could be a connection. Detective Denvers.
Excuse me.
Okay.
Uh, Sergeant.
Looks like we're gonna need that expertise of yours.
Buck.
Uh, no-no comment, Taylor.
That's not why I'm here. Really.
I'm not working this one.
I just heard a firefighter was shot.
You didn't answer my calls.
I got worried.
Sorry. I...
I-I wasn't checking my phone.
Is that blood?
Oh, it's, um, it's not mine, it's Eddie's.
Eddie's the one who got shot?
He was standing right in front of me.
And then, um...um...
I need to talk to Christopher.
Yeah.
I-I don't...I don't have my car.
I need to call a ride.
Why don't I drive you?
We can stop by your pla...
Uh, no. No, I-I got...
You can't go see his son looking like this.
Are you sure you're okay?
<i>Uh, he's pretty shaken up,</i> but otherwise fine. <i>Thank God.</i> When Buck didn't answer, I thought...<i>-I think he's just</i> in shock. <i>-Yeah. Just another trauma</i> to add to the pile. <i>We have an update now-</i> <i>-on an earlier story.</i> How is Eddie doing?
He's gonna be in surgery for the next few hours, so we won't know anything for a while.
<i>Buck's heading over to Eddie's place to, uh,</i> <i>-check in on Christopher.</i> Hey, Chim, they're saying on the news that a firefighter was shot at the scene of a car accident.
What? No, it wasn't a car accident.
<i>...but they report that she is a six-year veteran</i> <i>of the department, and she's now been transported...</i> Chim, they're not talking about Eddie.
Come on! She's been shot! Let's go!
Another firefighter? We were ambushed.
The shot came out of nowhere.
What the hell is going on?
They were responding to a fender-bender when the shooting started.
You see it?
The police, the bystanders, the two drivers.
Shooter had plenty of potential targets, if he was looking for someone random.
Yeah, but he didn't take the shot. He waited.
Until Fire and Rescue arrived.
He's targeting firefighters.
<i>I don't understand.</i> Who'd want to shoot at firefighters?
Does this happen a lot?
It's definitely not an everyday occurrence, but there have been some instances where a company responded to a scene and someone started shooting at them.
Never heard of shots fired at multiple scenes on the same day.
Kind of wish I wasn't hearing about it right now.
Oh! Oh.
Looks like your hand-eye coordination is back to normal.
Fully healed. Thanks to all of you.
And...
a lot of physical therapy.
So, what happens now?
We just wait for news about Eddie?
Or until the hospital staff kicks us off the campus.
It's been known to happen both ways.
Where's Buck?
He's got a harder job tonight.
Hey, Buck.
Hey.
Where's Dad?
Um, he...he's, uh, he's-he's not coming home tonight, Chris.
Why not?
Well, um...
well, he-he got hurt at work today.
In a fire?
Um...
uh...
no.
No, not-not in a fire.
Uh, the truth is, someone...hurt your dad.
On purpose?
Yeah, I think so.
A bad guy?
Mm-hmm.
Uh, y...yeah.
Yeah, yeah, a b...a-a bad guy.
Is he gonna be okay?
You know, your dad is, uh...
he's tough as nails.
He's a fighter, right?
So, uh, so he's-he's with the doctors now.
Like the ones that fixed you?
Uh-huh. Yeah, like-like the ones who fixed me.
Then he's gonna be okay, right?
Uh...
Yeah, I think so, buddy.
I think so.
It's gonna be okay, Buck.
<i>The Southland remains in the grip of an apparent sniper</i> who appears to be targeting firefighters and rescue personnel.
<i>And now it feels as if no open space</i> <i>is safe for the men and the women of the LAFD.</i> This is something we haven't faced before.
I know it's scary-- the idea that someone is targeting us.
He couldn't have had much time to set up.
Probably listening to a scanner, then rushing to calls.
Last time, he got lucky.
Found a building he could access.
So where would be lucky here?
How good a shot do we think he is?
<i>We still have a job to do.</i> We're just gonna have to do it a little differently now.
<i>LAPD is putting</i> additional officers out there every shift.
But we still have limited resources, so we're going to have to think strategically, and we're going to have to work together. <i>That's great, Cap,</i> but we're still sitting ducks.

<i>We don't give up.</i> <i>The SWAT team will protect us.</i> So I hear nobody got shot today.
That's good news.
Yeah, that was the first good news we've had all day.
I know you're tired.
Um, but I just wanted to say...
I'm sorry.
I overreacted.
I should have let you know what was going on instead of trying to prove some point.
I'm sorry, too.
I mean, the whole thing seems so silly now.
I never should have tailed you like a suspect.
Hmm.
You know, after I was attacked, we never really talked about it.
Well, I always got the sense you didn't want to.
No, I mean...
we never talked about what it was like for you.
There's that thing people say-- I don't know what I'd do without you.
Mm.
Because losing someone you love is such an alien concept.
You don't want to imagine what it's like.
Well, those people are not like us.
And I was sitting in that engine thinking I was listening to you dying.
And I didn't need to imagine anything.
I knew what my life would feel like without you in it, and it scared me.
I'm sorry I put you through that.
I know you were doing your job.
And I'm proud of you for that, but there is a small selfish part of me that wishes you didn't want to anymore.
I didn't.
No, after the attack and everything else going on in the world?
The last thing I wanted to do was ever put that uniform on again.
And then Elaine brought up retirement.
And I really did struggle with that decision.
Why didn't you tell me about that so I could help you through it?
Because I knew what you would do.
You would support me.
Give me permission to quit.
And I couldn't.
Couldn't let the bad guys win.
Mm-mm.
That's who you are.
You're a survivor.
We're survivors.
Good morning!
Oh, are we still in our pajamas?
School starts in 20 minutes.
Sorry, that's-that's my fault.
Slept through the alarm.
Oh, no, that's good-- that means you're getting some sleep.
Ah.
Buck snores loud.
Well, that's also good to know.
Okay. I, uh...
I think it's time someone got ready for school.
I'll go. But I'm gonna need a nap later.
Because of all the snoring.
Yes. Okay.
Oh, my goodness.
He seems to be doing okay.
Y...
You think he understands what's going on?
Boy's already lost his mother.
I think he understands more than we'd like him to.
Now, what about you?
I mean, how is it being back out there?
It's weird.
You know, the...
team feels off without Eddie.
Not what I was asking about.
I'm really worried about you being out there.
I'm, uh...
I'm fine.
I'm not the one who got shot.
Williams, you're with us.
What's going on?!
We didn't ask for cops! Our buddy's hurt!
Gentlemen, the police are here just as a precaution.
The sniper.
You've got a man pinned by a cable up there?
Don't know how the hell the cable came unseated, but it's got that on the end of it.
There's at least a couple thousand pounds of pressure on his arm. You can see it on the feed.
All right, take us there.
Poor Cliff, huh?
Yeah.
That beam goes, it's taking his arm with him.
Ooh. An arterial bleed, Cap.
With travel time, he's got eight minutes.
Maybe ten. It's pretty high up his arm.
He could bleed out quick. I talked to SWAT.
They're still ten minutes out.
Airship?
Maybe less, but not by much.
You'd be completely exposed up there, Captain.
We can't protect you. Look, we can sit here trying to do the math, Cap, but we got to get up there.
Uh, I think he beat you to it.
Of course he did.
Buck, nobody cleared you to go up there.
<i>You are completely exposed and we don't have</i> <i>any way to protect you. Buckley.</i> <i>Buckley, respond.</i> I got this, Cap.
I brought a tourniquet. Hen and Chim <i>can walk me through anything else I need to do.</i> Can you blame him, Cap?
Yeah.
Buck's gonna Buck.
<i>All right, Buck, his name is Cliff.</i> <i>And that cable that's got him pinned--</i> <i>there's no way to move it.</i> <i>You got to cut it to drop the beam</i> <i>-and release the pressure. But the tourniquet</i> <i>goes on first. We'll walk you through it.</i> Oh, man, he's not looking too good.
Hey, Cliff.
My name is Buck.
And I'm gonna need to get you down.
Get this off of me!
Deal. First, we get this tourniquet on you, okay?
Hen, Chim, <i>I'm prepping the tourniquet.</i> You want to place it well above the wound.
Ah...
Don't forget to warn him.
Hey, Cliff, um, so this is gonna hurt.
<i>-Okay. Cutting the cable.</i> Make sure the area is clear down there.
Copy that. All clear.
Okay, Cliff. Gonna get you down.
All right, almost done.
There you are. There we go.
Hang in there, buddy. You're gonna be okay.
You sure about that? What about my arm?
Might be some nerve damage, but I think he'll keep his arm.
Thank you.
Don't thank us.
Thank the crazy guy.
Are you ever gonna say anything?
I don't know, Buck. What would you like me to say?
Uh, I mean-I mean, usually, it's...
"What were you thinking?" "That was reckless." Or my...
personal favorite, "You could've been killed." No, it doesn't seem like I need to have the conversation.
You know it by heart already.
And, still, you went full Buck.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
You'll never be the guy who thinks before he acts.
And I've learned to come to terms with that.
In part because I realized I don't have a choice.
You're never gonna change.
But also because I know, whatever actions you take, no matter how dangerous or impulsive they may be, they come from your heart.
Because you care.
Wow.
Thank you.
Today was not that.
You didn't get caught up in some moment and rush in where angels fear to tread.
You made a deliberate choice to make yourself a target.
Yeah.
I made myself a target because I wasn't gonna let any of you guys take that risk because I cannot handle anyone else getting hurt right now.
Buck, what happened to Eddie was not your fault.
No. No, I was just the guy standing there when it happened who couldn't do anything to protect him.
Well, today, I could do something to protect the rest of you.
So I did.
We are a team, and we're supposed to protect each other.
Don't do it again.
<i>That was it?</i> Yeah, it felt like some kind of weird reverse psychology thing.
Think I prefer it when he just yells at me.
Oh, I could yell at you if you think that would help.
Oh, come on, you can't be mad. You weren't even there.
There's at least half a dozen videos on the Internet of your climb up that crane.
All taken from nearby windows. Any one of those people could have had a gun and shot at your big, stupid head.
I was wearing a helmet.
Not made of Kevlar, dumbass.
Hold on a second. It almost sounds like you were worried about me.
I'm annoyed with you.
You're not invincible. You could've gotten hurt.
Or worse.
But I didn't.
Sorry.
Uh...
Okay.
Not sure where that came from.
Could be the wine.
Uh, ma-maybe we should talk about it.
Mm.
I should go.
W...
Ana.
Is everything okay?
Hey, Buck.
Hey.
<i>Hey, Dad.</i> I miss you. <i>-I miss you, too.</i> <i>ut I'm gonna see you real soon.
B</i> <i>'ll be home before you know it.
I</i> Let yourself heal first, please.
You don't have anything to worry about.
Buck and I have it under control.
<i>Thanks.</i> Love you, Dad.
<i>I love you too.</i> Appreciate you staying with him.
Carla offered to bring him to her house, but, uh, I figured this was overwhelming enough without having to sleep in a strange bed.
He doing okay?
Better than me.
Uh...
I kind of lost it when I told him you got shot.
I-I'm sorry. I should've held it together.
You were there for him when I couldn't be.
That's what matters.
Still.
I think it might have been better for him if I was the one who got shot.
I heard the ballistics report from our shell casings came in.
They didn't send a report.
They sent him.
Chief Pate.
Sergeant.
Close the door.
The casing you found was from a .308-caliber round.
Fits what a sniper would use.
And matches the slugs from both scenes.
But none of that brings a deputy chief to deliver the news.
The ammunition was match grade.
More accurate, more expensive and much more traceable. Down to the lot number.
Ballistics reached out to the manufacturer to identify the purchaser.
Then they called me.
So our sniper didn't get his ammo from a gun shop.
He got it from us.
That bullet belongs to the LAPD.
Fire.
Go, go, go, go, go!
LAPD!
Kenneth Malone! Room clear.
Clear.
LAPD! Stay where you are! Hands on your head.
<i>Kenneth Malone.</i> <i>Eight years as a SWAT long rifleman</i> till he got fired six months ago after he accidentally shot a hostage.
Got a plan to get him talking?
Mm-hmm.
You.
You're the one wearing stripes on your arm, Sergeant.
And he strikes me as the type who'll respond to that.
<i>They got the sniper. He's in custody.</i> That's a relief.
Yeah. Now things can get back to normal.
Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
This isn't going to be a happy talk, is it?
I'm quitting, Sue.
Is everything okay at home?
I know you've been worried about Jee.
I'm failing her.
I'm just so tired all the time, and I can't focus, and I feel like I'm in this fog that I can't get free of.
And I need to do better. I-I need to...
I need to be better.
And I can't do that and be here.
You know, if you feel like you need to spend more time at home, I understand.
But I want you to talk to...
Please don't say the counselors.
I want you to talk to Chimney.
What?
What you're describing and what I see when you're here, it feels like something more than just having too much on your plate.
Talk to him, Maddie.
<i>The LAPD armory</i> <i>keeps a detailed log of all match grade ammo.</i> The rounds used were issued to you while you were at SWAT.
That's crap.
I haven't touched a weapon in months.
Not since the...
The factory?
Right.
You shot the wrong man.
I'm guessing that whole business felt unfair.
The news turning you into public enemy number one.
You losing your job.
I quit my job.
When the department wanted to do a review, I told them not to bother.
I'd make it easy for everyone and I'd leave.
I didn't care about being cleared.
I cared that I made a mistake that I'm still trying to figure out how to live with.
I'm telling you, you got the wrong person.
You're looking for a guy who hates firefighters.
Hell, I wake up every morning grateful for them.
That they saved the one person I couldn't.
Can you tell me your location, sir?
<i>ETHAN 544 Hazleton.</i> What's your name, sir?
Ethan.
<i>-Ethan, are you there?</i> Dispatch said there is a single victim inside.
Name is Ethan. Buck, Ravi, hook us up to some hydrants. Start hitting it from out here.
Hen, Chim, you're with me.
Copy that.
Copy that.
Glad we don't need the bulletproof vests anymore.
Yeah.
I'm not missing them.
<i>They found Malone's gun</i> right where he said it'd be, buried in the yard.
Hasn't been fired in months.
Could be he used a different weapon.
Doesn't really feel like that, though, does it?
I don't think he's our guy.
But this ammo was his.
That's not a mistake.
So someone else had access to it. But who?
Hmm.
Riflemen don't work alone.
They work in pairs.
Ethan! You in there?
LAFD!
Ethan! Ethan!
No sign of him, Cap.
Dispatch said he might be unconscious.
I'm heading up to three.
Copy that, Cap!
LAFD! Anybody up here?
LAFD!
<i>118, we have an order to evacuate the building.</i> Evacuate? On whose authority?
<i>LAPD.</i> Ethan?
Ethan!
LAFD! Can you hear me?
Ethan!
Come in, captain Nash.
Cap, respond.
What's your 20?
Bobby's still inside?
They ordered everybody out the building, but he didn't follow.
He said he had eyes on our victim, Ethan.
Ethan Copeland?
He's not a victim. He's the sniper.
<i>Come in, Captain Nash.</i> Call them back in here. Do it.
And if I don't, what-- we burn?
Call 'em in.
Tell them you broke your leg or something. Do it.
Nah.
Think you've shot enough firefighters already.
The sniper's LAPD? Ex-LAPD.
After his partner quit, we realized Copeland was a problem and we removed him from duty.
Now he's making everybody pay for it.
Anybody have any idea where inside this building Bobby is?
He called it out when he found the guy.
Third floor, bravo side.
Somewhere around that window. All right.
SWAT's right behind us. We're taking over this scene.
You're taking over the fire?
Who are you?
Howard Han, 118.
And I guess since my captain's trapped inside that fire, <i>I'm</i> in charge of this scene.
Cap, come in.
Can you get me in there?
Look, I don't think Bobby...
Bobby's gonna die in there, Buck.
You need to help me. Help you do what?
Go get my husband.
<i>You're insane. We're both gonna die in here. For what?</i> I'm done either way, so I might as well take as many of you out with me as I can.
Nobody's coming in. <i>It'll be easy.</i> Cut in on the delta side, where most of the fire's been contained.
She drops in, she makes her way across to bravo.
Except she'll be in a fire.
Put the gear on me. I'll be protected.
Trust me, I'm not gonna be in there that long.
Listen, we've got one of our own in there.
He's unprotected, possibly injured.
I need to know what your plan is before you make a move.
Just let me get my guys in position. Then I'll brief you.
We need to knock this fire down so we can go in there and get Cap.
Yeah. About that.
All right, come on, come on.
<i>Where the hell are they?</i> You didn't make it easy.
The building is engulfed.
But it's not too late. You can still save yourself.
I can help you get out of here.
You ever think it's just a waste of time, Captain?
That some lives just don't deserve saving?
Everyone...deserves to be saved.
I'm going with you.
No, Buck.
I can't protect you in there.
He's trying to kill firefighters.
Yeah, and you're dressed as one.
All right, I'm going in.
Now tell me what to do.
<i>You know, there was a guy</i> that took this place hostage a few months back.
Hurt a bunch of people.
Me and my partner-- we tried to stop him.
But we made a mistake, and my partner shot the wrong person.
An innocent man got hurt.
We all make mistakes.
The thing is, that gunman...
shouldn't have been alive.
He'd OD'd multiple times.
But you firefighters-- you so-called heroes-- you kept saving him!
That's the job.
You saved his life so he could go ruin someone else's!
We don't choose who lives or dies.
We save everyone we can.
You don't have to make the tough choices.
But people love you for it, and hate guys like me.
Chief, be advised, I have eyes on the suspect.
<i>Do you have a clean shot?</i> Negative. Target red.
<i>You think saving lives</i> is a hard job?
Try having to take them.
Athena?
This is Athena Grant. Suspect is down.
Need medical assistance.
Captain Nash has been shot.
Athena, how did you...
I'm here.
I got you.
Hey.
Welcome back.
Ethan?
He didn't make it.
Once we arrested Malone, Ethan knew it was just a matter of time before we figured out he was the real sniper.
You went into a burning building.
I didn't imagine that part, right?
You actually walked through fire.
Well...you were inside.
I wasn't gonna let a little fire stop me.
I needed to get my partner back.
Thanks for coming to get me.
Always.
You are not dead.
And you came back.
Uh, wasn't sure that was gonna happen.
Yeah. I kind of ran away.
Yeah, I noticed.
You didn't chase after me.
Listen, I, uh...I spent a long time feeling like I wasn't enough.
And I don't want to do that anymore.
So if you don't want me...
I do.
I really do.
Are you napping without me?
I quit my job.
What?
Did something happen?
Are you okay?
No, I'm not okay.
I'm not okay in here.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
I need help.
Okay.
I'll get you help, whatever it is.
We'll get you help, okay?
Uh-oh. I think I forgot the juice boxes.
Denny might have a meltdown.
My sweet baby? He would never.
Oh, you are such a grandmother.
You have no idea.
No.
Mommy Karen! Mommy Hen!
Oh! Nia!
What? What are you...Nia.
Nia? It's Mommy Hen and Mommy Karen.
Hi!
Nia. Nia, we should go.
Grammy!
Hi, precious. Look at you.
You are getting so big!
Your mommy must be feeding you well.
Where's big brother?
Hey, Nia!
Jungle gym. Jungle...
Don't worry. I got her.
Um...I'm-I'm Hen, and this is my wife Karen.
Nia's foster parents.
This is awkward.
I don't know what the rules are.
I...I don't think there are any.
I've thought so much about you.
About the things I wished I could say to you.
But now I don't...
How about we start with lunch?
We were just about to sit down to a little picnic.
Yeah, there's plenty.
Grammy doesn't know about portion control.
That'd be nice.
Thank you.
That's the thing I wanted to say.
Thank you.
Come on.
Okay, uh, nurse is getting your meds and discharge papers ready.
Then we can get out of here.
Great.
Hey, since we got a minute...
Uh, is everything all right?
Yeah, yeah, I'm just, uh, I've been meaning to talk to you about something.
Okay.
So, you might have noticed I almost died.
Again.
Yeah, I've had a lot of close calls.
This one wasn't even my closest.
Yeah. Eddie...
Just let me finish.
After the last time, when that well collapsed on top of me...
Which you survived.
After that...
it got me thinking.
You know, what would happen to Christopher if I hadn't?
So I went to my attorney and changed my will.
So, someday, if, I, uh...
didn't make it...Christopher would be taken care of.
By you.
What?
It's in my will, if I die, you become Christopher's legal guardian.
