Well, you're meeting her parents.
We're meeting everybody. Her parents, her tíos,her tías,her primos.
Her whole family's going to be there.
(exhales) It's a baby christening.

I was on Willoughby. It told me to turn left.
It sent me straight into the water!
I found you. Help is on the way.
The water's getting higher!
Are they gonna get here in time?
Fire and rescue are plan B.
What's plan A?
Can you swim?
What?
Kirby. Can you swim?
Yes, but I'm still sinking and the door won't open!
You can't open the door because the pressure of the water outside is greater than the pressure inside.
But it will equalize.
When that happens, you're gonna open the door and swim to surface.
(scoffs) I have to let myself sink?
I'm-I'm going to drown in here!
I don't want to die!
Kirby, stop.
I'm not ready!
Do not panic.
I don't wanna die!
You're gonna listen to me and we're gonna get you out of that car. Okay?
Okay, okay.
First, take off your seat belt.
Then, kick off your shoes. Jacket, too.
Anything that's gonna weigh you down needs to go.
Keep your mouth and nose above the water for as long as you can.
When the water starts to cover your face, that's when you'll take a big breath of air, as much as you can.
And then I open the door?
Just enough to slip out.
Okay.
The car will fall away from you.
Then, you kick-kick-kick your way to the surface.

There were accidents all over the city.

Whatever happened wasn't a bug in their software.
So what was it?
It was a ransomware attack.
Now, where'd you hear that?
She knows a guy.
You know a guy?
I'm an engineer, Michael. I know a lot of guys.
Mm.
Anyway, this one works at GoGo Anywhere, and, uh, he wanted to know if I knew of anyone else who had been hit.
And?
A defense contractor in Texas. Last week.
And another one in Michigan, the week before that.
And this is the first time we're hearing about this?
You also didn't hear about the other 4,000 cyberattacks that happen every day.
Yeah, but there's backups, right?
You know, redundancies, firewalls.
Systems designed to-to help protect us from being kicked back into the dark ages by faceless guys on the Internet.

What?
Look, there is no way to perfectly protect any system.
Right? And most things in our lives are run on some sort of automated system.

CLERK: Next case before the court, The State of California v. Jeffery Connor Hudson.
Pretrial motions. Honorable Judge Priya Atkins presiding.
Bring in the defendant.
(lock buzzes) (women giggling) Oh, look. His fan club's here.
(gavel bangs) ATKINS: We're on the record.
All right, whom do we have present?
Your Honor, Ken Decker for the state.
(quietly): You need me to...
Does the defense need a moment?
Your Honor, the defendant has informed me that my services will no longer be required.
He just fired me.
He intends to represent himself.
Objection...
What do you mean, objection?
ATKINS: Settle down. Order!
This is me trying to get a fair trial.
(gavel banging) Settle down. Mr. Hudson, if I do allow you to represent yourself, you'll do so with decorum and you'll follow the rules.
Mr. Decker, I'll hear what you have to say.
Everyone else, please sit down.
Ms. Risco, for the time being, that includes you.
Your Honor, this defendant is charged with six counts of rape.
Heinous crimes that involved him stalking his victims, lying in wait inside their homes, and then viciously attacking them. In addition, he brutally assaulted an LAPD sergeant, beating her nearly to death.
All of these women will be key witnesses in this trial.
To subject them to being questioned by their attacker would be tantamount to allowing him to assault them again.
I'd like to see counsel in chambers.
(gavel bangs) Here you are.
Thanks.
Is he really gonna get to do this?
Be the one firing questions at us?
Because I don't think I can take that.
Which is what he wants. But you all are stronger than he thinks.
Damn right. You've already proven it.
So let's just wait and see what the judge says.
Oh, God, look at them.
So disgusting.
Have you seen their "Free Jeffery Hudson" Facebook group?
Women like that have something broken inside of them that makes them fall for psychopaths.
Don't look at them. They don't deserve your attention.
Hey, Athena.
I'm sorry. The judge is going to allow Hudson to represent himself.
ATHENA: All right.
Remember what we said. He can't hurt you.
Just stay strong.
DECKER: Glad to hear you feel that way.
He also just filed a motion to suppress all evidence found at Studio Self Storage.
(scoffs) Those trophies are all that we have linking Hudson back to his victims.
I'm aware of that. Believe me.
Sergeant Grant nearly gave her life to get us that evidence.
I'm aware of that, too. And so is the judge.
She's going to hear arguments next session.
She's actually considering this motion?
DECKER: She is. And she's allowing Hudson to call his first witness: you.

It's not possible. I-I don't panic.
Because you're a guy?
And a firefighter.
Now that's a stressful job.
This didn't happen on the job.
Panic attacks aren't rational, Mr. Diaz.
But they can be an indicator of some underlying anxiety.
Have you experienced any lifestyle changes lately?
Any new stressors?
No. Nothing. It's been great.

♪ It may sound funny, but I don't believe ♪ ♪ She's coming, oh, oh...♪ Sergeant Grant, are you familiar with a facility known as "Studio Self Storage"?
Intimately.
And on the evening of May 4, 2020, did you have occasion to enter this facility?
I did.
And who granted you access to this business?
No one did. I just walked in.
JEFFERY: You just walked in?
With a warrant?
No warrant was necessary.
Really? How's that?
I observed that an outside door had been suspiciously wedged open, so I conducted a business check.
Right, right. "Business check." That's, uh, one of those phrases cops deploy when they want to get around pesky things like warrants.
Prejudicial, Your Honor.
Mr. Hudson, let's keep it in check.
Did anyone else see this suspiciously wedged open door, Sergeant Grant?
No.
No. Just you.
And did you turn on your body camera when you entered?
I didn't get a chance to. I was attacked...by you.
That's your version.
I remember it the other way around.
As I recall, a lot of people heard it over the radio.
Oh. Then I'm sure they heard you identify yourself as police, hmm?
I followed procedure.
Of course.
Sergeant Grant, how many times have you been put on restricted duty for misconduct?
A few.
How about five times?
I'm good police.
No. My, uh...
my personal favorite is the time that you threatened a teenage girl you felt was bullying your daughter.
I felt?
That girl drove my daughter to attempt suicide.
So you arrested this minor, and you threw her in jail.
You know, some people might consider that an abuse of power.
She had drugs on her person.
She said they weren't hers.
They usually do.
And sometimes police plant evidence.
Your Honor!
Mr. Hudson, are we approaching a point?
Given that the state's entire case against me rests on this so-called evidence obtained by an illegal search by a rogue cop with a history of misconduct, I would move that all items claimed to have been found at Studio Self Storage be suppressed and not considered evidence in this trial.

PILOT: Roger that. Medevac 305, approaching the pad.
(horn honking) Athena, how close are you to the Little Tokyo address?
ATHENA: I'm close. Trouble is, nothing is moving.
Traffic's a nightmare.
Listen, I'm almost at the Echo Park address, Cynthia Walden.
Why don't you let me check it out, and then I'll meet you in Little Tokyo.
You want me to wait for you? No.
There's a reason we split up, Lou.
I'm not letting this dirtbag get away again.
RANSONE: I need to remind you, the last time you faced this guy alone in a blackout, it didn't go so good.
Yeah, well, it won't go down like that again.
Not this time. Not today.
(siren wailing) (tires screeching) (sirens wailing in distance) Medevac, I see you!
We're ready to receive the package.
Is everyone good back there?
MANNY: We're good.
Detective Ransone. LAPD.
Mind if I take a look around?
Come on in.
♪ RANSONE: Expecting company?
I set the table for him every night.
MAYOR: Today, Los Angeles has been held hostage by an unscrupulous band of criminals who prefer to hide in the shadows.
Open it. Now.
MAYOR: Well, let me be clear. The city of Los Angeles does not negotiate with terrorists.
Don't move!
MANNY: Whoa. Are you seeing this?
(sighs) Because of course.
PILOT: Mayday! Mayday! We're coming in hot.
(panicked chatter) PILOT: What the hell?
I can't see the pad. Hang on!
(alert beeping) Generators should have kicked in automatically.
Something's wrong.
Chim's finding out where they are.
All right, thank you. Guys, back of the building, near the service doors.
Buck, get the tools, meet us there.
Copy that.
What the hell?
(alert beeping) I lost the whole tail rotor.
Hang on!
(crash rumbling) That came from the roof.
The generators will have to wait.
LAPD. Put your hands up.
Relax.
I saw you through the peephole.
Step back. Keep your hands up.
Y-You can't come in here without a warrant.
If I think you're harboring a criminal, I absolutely can. Move!
Stop right there.
Open it.
All right.
ATHENA: The closet.
You're wrong about him, you know.
Jeffery would never hurt a soul.
You're telling that tale to the wrong woman.
Oh, right. That fight you lost to him.
He said you attacked him.
He said he was defending himself.
That what he said?
Jeffery always has to defend himself.
That's why he had to fire that bitch lawyer.
He blamed her for everything. He said it was all her fault.
(sighs) (water running) (gasps) Evening, Counselor.
Jeffery, you scared the hell out of me.
Put your shoes back on.
Now!
You know, I really got to thank you.
If you hadn't given me such truly terrible legal advice, I never would have fired you, and I'd still be sitting in a damn cage right now.
So thanks for sucking.
I don't think I gave you terrible advice.
Really?
You wanted to plead me down.
You had no intention of fighting for me.
I wonder if you got any real fight in you at all, Lila.
Guess we're gonna have to find out, huh?
Do you have any cash?
Some.
Where are we going?
I don't know yet.
Roads are pretty jammed, but we're gonna figure out something.
Oh!
Ah!
Hey, Jeff.
You okay?
Yeah. I-I think so.
(Jeff grunting) ("Retrograde" by James Blake playing) RANSONE: Gotta hand it to you, Sergeant. When your instincts are right, they are very, very right.
ATHENA: You got him?
We got him, Athena.
Oh, praise the Lord.
Oh, that's great news, Lou. Oh, the lawyer?
A bit shaken up, but she'll be fine.
Jeffery's big adventure is done. He's going back to lockup.
I know some people who are going to be very happy to hear that.
♪ You're on your own...♪ COLLEEN: Hello?
ATHENA: Colleen? It's Sergeant Grant.
We got him.
Oh, my God. Really?
ATHENA: Really.
COLLEEN: That is such a relief.
ATHENA: I know, baby.
You can go home now. It's safe.
