Ana's sister's having a baby.

You and Chris at the christening?
That sounds serious.
It's not.
Not the way you guys are making it sound.

Are they gonna get here in time?
Fire and rescue are plan B.
What's plan A?
Can you swim?
What?
Kirby. Can you swim?
Yes, but I'm still sinking and the door won't open!
You can't open the door because the pressure of the water outside is greater than the pressure inside.
But it will equalize.
<em>When that happens, you're gonna open the door and swim to surface.</em>

Okay, okay.
First, take off your seat belt.
Then, kick off your shoes. Jacket, too.

Keep your mouth and nose above the water for as long as you can.

And then I open the door?
Just enough to slip out.
Okay.
<em>The car will fall away from you. Then, you kick-kick-kick your way to the surface.</em>

<strong>Clerk</strong>: <em>Next case before the court,</em>
The State of California v. Jeffery Connor Hudson.
Pretrial motions. Honorable Judge Priya Atkins presiding.
Bring in the defendant.
(<em>lock buzzes</em>)
(<em>women giggling</em>)
Oh, look. His fan club's here.
(<em>gavel bangs</em>)
<strong>Atkins</strong>: We're on the record.
All right, whom do we have present?
Your Honor, Ken Decker for the state.
(<em>quietly</em>): You need me to...
Does the defense need a moment?
Your Honor, the defendant has informed me that my services will no longer be required.
He just fired me.
He intends to represent himself.
Objection...
What do you mean, objection?
<strong>Atkins</strong>: Settle down. Order!
This is me trying to get a fair trial.
(<em>gavel banging</em>)
Settle down. Mr. Hudson, if I do allow you to represent yourself, you'll do so with decorum and you'll follow the rules.
Mr. Decker, I'll hear what you have to say.
Everyone else, please sit down.
Ms. Risco, for the time being, that includes you.
Your Honor, this defendant is charged with six counts of rape.
Heinous crimes that involved him stalking his victims, lying in wait inside their homes, and then viciously attacking them. In addition, he brutally assaulted an LAPD sergeant, beating her nearly to death.
All of these women will be key witnesses in this trial.
To subject them to being questioned by their attacker would be tantamount to allowing him to assault them again.
I'd like to see counsel in chambers.
(<em>gavel bangs</em>)
Here you are.
Thanks.
Is he really gonna get to do this?
Be the one firing questions at us?
Because I don't think I can take that.
Which is what he wants. But you all are stronger than he thinks.
Damn right. You've already proven it.
So let's just wait and see what the judge says.
Oh, God, look at them.
So disgusting.
Have you seen their &quot;Free Jeffery Hudson&quot; Facebook group?
Women like that have something broken inside of them that makes them fall for psychopaths.
Don't look at them. They don't deserve your attention.
Hey, Athena.
I'm sorry. The judge is going to allow Hudson to represent himself.
<strong>Athena</strong>: All right.
Remember what we said. He can't hurt you.
Just stay strong.
<strong>Decker</strong>: Glad to hear you feel that way.
He also just filed a motion to suppress all evidence found at Studio Self Storage.
(<em>scoffs</em>) Those trophies are all that we have linking Hudson back to his victims.
I'm aware of that. Believe me.
Sergeant Grant nearly gave her life to get us that evidence.
I'm aware of that, too. And so is the judge.
She's going to hear arguments next session.
She's actually considering this motion?
<strong>Decker</strong>: She is. And she's allowing Hudson to call his first witness: you.

Sergeant Grant, are you familiar with a facility known as &quot;Studio Self Storage&quot;?
Intimately.
And on the evening of May 4, 2020, did you have occasion to enter this facility?
I did.
And who granted you access to this business?
No one did. I just walked in.
<strong>Jeffery</strong>: You just walked in?
With a warrant?
No warrant was necessary.
Really? How's that?
I observed that an outside door had been suspiciously wedged open, so I conducted a business check.
Right, right. &quot;Business check.&quot;
That's, uh, one of those phrases cops deploy when they want to get around pesky things like warrants.
Prejudicial, Your Honor.
Mr. Hudson, let's keep it in check.
Did anyone else see this suspiciously wedged open door, Sergeant Grant?
No.
No. Just you.
And did you turn on your body camera when you entered?
I didn't get a chance to. I was attacked... by you.
That's your version.
I remember it the other way around.
As I recall, a lot of people heard it over the radio.
Oh. Then I'm sure they heard you identify yourself as police, hmm?
I followed procedure.
Of course.
Sergeant Grant, how many times have you been put on restricted duty for misconduct?
A few.
How about five times?
I'm good police.
No. My, uh... my personal favorite is the time that you threatened a teenage girl you felt was bullying your daughter.
I felt?
That girl drove my daughter to attempt suicide.
So you arrested this minor, and you threw her in jail.
You know, some people might consider that an abuse of power.
She had drugs on her person.
She said they weren't hers.
They usually do.
And sometimes police plant evidence.
Your Honor!
Mr. Hudson, are we approaching a point?
Given that the state's entire case against me rests on this so-called evidence obtained by an illegal search by a rogue cop with a history of misconduct, I would move that all items claimed to have been found at Studio Self Storage be suppressed and not considered evidence in this trial.
(<em>gallery murmuring</em>)
Thank you.
(<em>gavel bangs</em>)
<strong>Atkins</strong>: All right.
Let's take a recess while I consider my ruling.
You may step down, Sergeant Grant.

Chaos spread to the downtown courthouse...</em>
(<em>people screaming</em>)
Okay. Well...
I guess your daddy's gonna be pretty busy today.
(<em>sirens wailing</em>)
Dr. Salazar, three MIs.
Three? Uh, all right.
Uh, exam rooms four through six. All three get a full panel, EKG and chest CTs. Dear God, if that's even working.
(<em>indistinct P.A. announcement</em>)
Mr. Diaz? I wasn't expecting to see you again so soon.
How you feeling?
Good. All good.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: What a mess.
Oh, beyond. We are having to bust into our prescription cases just to get access to any drugs, not that we know who to give them to.
We are locked out of our computers, so no patient charts.
IV drip rates are being calculated with a stopwatch and a white board.
And every vent on this floor just shut down, so we are bagging patients by hand.
<strong>Nurse</strong>: Dr. Salazar, Mr. Rudnick is prepped.
Transplant team is ready in OR three.
That's great, but we're not starting without the heart.
I'm on with the pilot. They're 12 minutes out.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Sounds like you could use some extra hands.
Just tell us where you want us.
Everywhere?
<strong>Colleen</strong>: <em>What do you mean, gone?</em>
Systems all over the city were hit in one mass attack.
Not just the courthouse.
This police station, trains.
I hear they're even having trouble at the zoo.
Those aren't the cages I'm worried about.
I mean, he's out there now. He's really out there.
We will find him.
What if he finds us? He knows where we live.
Which is why I don't think you should go home.
Not for a while.
Stay with friends, family, get a hotel.
I'll let you know when it is safe.
<strong>Ransone</strong>: <em>You have no idea where he might go?</em>
No, I don't.
Do you think there's any chance he might reach out to you?
He fired me, remember?
Yeah.
Any idea why he did that?
Isn't it obvious? He likes to have control.
He can't stand it if someone else does, especially a woman.
I've noticed. What can you tell us about these women?
His fan club?
Any chance any one or more of them would shelter him if he knocked on their door?
Any of them... in a heartbeat.
You wouldn't happen to have their names or addresses, would you?
No, but I know who would.
They all visited him in lockup.
Visitor's log at Men's Central.
(<em>indistinct P.A. announcement</em>)
Hey, what was with that doctor on the way in?
Why is she asking if you're all right?
It was nothing. I wasn't feeling well the other day, so... she checked me out.
She's a-a cardiologist.
At a hospital. Are you saying you had a heart attack?
No, I'm not saying I had a heart attack.
I'm saying the opposite.
I'm saying I <em>didn't</em> have a heart attack.
But you did think you were having a heart attack.
Can we just drop this?
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Think the trauma bay's on its feet for now.
We did all we could. Little snip there, little stitch here.
You guys want us to tag you out?
Give you a break?
Yeah.
Great idea. Eddie really shouldn't be exerting himself right now.
Seriously, Buck?
(<em>indistinct P.A. announcement</em>)
Chopper 305, I'm heading up to the roof now. Over.
<strong>Pilot</strong>: <em>Roger that. Medevac 305, approaching the pad.</em>
(<em>horn honking</em>)
Athena, how close are you to the Little Tokyo address?
<strong>Athena</strong>: <em>I'm close. Trouble is, nothing is moving.</em>
Traffic's a nightmare.
<em>Listen, I'm almost at the Echo Park address,</em>
Cynthia Walden.
Why don't you let me check it out, and then I'll meet you in Little Tokyo.
<em>You want me to wait for you? No.</em>
There's a reason we split up, Lou.
I'm not letting this dirtbag get away again.
<strong>Ransone</strong>: <em>I need to remind you,</em> the last time you faced this guy alone in a blackout, it didn't go so good.
Yeah, well, it won't go down like that again.
Not this time. Not today.
(<em>siren wailing</em>)
(<em>tires screeching</em>)
(<em>sirens wailing in distance</em>)
Medevac, I see you!
<em>We're ready to receive the package.</em>
Is everyone good back there?
<strong>Manny</strong>: We're good.
Detective Ransone. LAPD.
Mind if I take a look around?
Come on in.

<strong>Ransone</strong>: Expecting company?
I set the table for him every night.
<strong>Mayor</strong>: <em>Today, Los Angeles has been held hostage by an unscrupulous band of criminals who prefer to hide in the shadows.</em>
Open it. Now.
<strong>Mayor</strong>: <em>Well, let me be clear. The city of Los Angeles does not negotiate with terrorists.</em>
Don't move!
<strong>Manny</strong>: <em>Whoa. Are you seeing this?</em>
(<em>sighs</em>) Because of course.
<strong>Pilot</strong>: Mayday! Mayday! We're coming in hot.
(<em>panicked chatter</em>)
<strong>Pilot</strong>: <em>What the hell?</em>
I can't see the pad. Hang on!
(<em>alert beeping</em>)
Generators should have kicked in automatically.
Something's wrong.
Chim's finding out where they are.
All right, thank you. Guys, back of the building, near the service doors.
Buck, get the tools, meet us there.
Copy that.
What the hell?
(<em>alert beeping</em>)
I lost the whole tail rotor.
Hang on!
(<em>crash rumbling</em>)
That came from the roof.
The generators will have to wait.
LAPD. Put your hands up.
Relax.
I saw you through the peephole.
Step back. Keep your hands up.
Y-You can't come in here without a warrant.
If I think you're harboring a criminal, I absolutely can. Move!
Stop right there.
Open it.
All right.
<strong>Athena</strong>: <em>The closet.</em>
You're wrong about him, you know.
Jeffery would never hurt a soul.
You're telling that tale to the wrong woman.
Oh, right. That fight you lost to him.
He said you attacked him.
He said he was defending himself.
That what he said?
Jeffery always has to defend himself.
That's why he had to fire that b¡tch lawyer.
He blamed her for everything. He said it was all her fault.
(<em>sighs</em>)
(<em>water running</em>)
(<em>gasps</em>)
Evening, Counselor.
Jeffery, you scared the hell out of me.
Put your shoes back on.
Now!
You know, I really got to thank you.
If you hadn't given me such truly terrible legal advice, I never would have fired you, and I'd still be sitting in a damn cage right now.
So thanks for sucking.
I don't think I gave you terrible advice.
Really?
You wanted to plead me down.
You had no intention of fighting for me.
I wonder if you got any real fight in you at all, Lila.
Guess we're gonna have to find out, huh?
Do you have any cash?
Some.
Where are we going?
I don't know yet.
Roads are pretty jammed, but we're gonna figure out something.
Oh!
Ah!
Hey, Jeff.
You okay?
Yeah. I-I think so.
(<em>Jeff grunting</em>)

<strong>Athena</strong>: <em>You got him?
We got him, Athena.</em>
Oh, praise the Lord.
Oh, that's great news, Lou. Oh, the lawyer?
A bit shaken up, but she'll be fine.
Jeffery's big adventure is done. He's going back to lockup.
I know some people who are going to be very happy to hear that.
