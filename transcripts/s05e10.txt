Hey, hon, it's me.
Not sure if you're in the air yet, but we're about to see Santa.

I know Elise would love to see her daddy.
So would I. Love you.
No Mr. Darcola?
Probably about to take off.
I'm just glad we get him on the actual day this year.
The holidays are always less fun when he's working.
It must be hard that he's away so much.

At least I get him every other Christmas.

No, sweetie, we're gonna see Santa Claus.

I don't have to prove anything. I don't even know who you are.
Artie has never even mentioned you.
I think Artie hasn't talked about a lot of things.
Ain't that right, Artie?
<strong>Buck</strong>: What do we think?
Some kind of road rage incident? Or trolley rage?
Definitely sensing some kind of rage.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Hey, Ravi, you go check on the driver.
Buck and Eddie, you're gonna handle this victim.
Okay, we've got an injured man down on the ground.
Let's give the officers a break.
Can one of you tell me what happened?
This woman is having an affair with my husband.
This woman is lying.
He is my husband. I have a ring and everything.
My husband is wearing a matching one.
You can check it if you don't believe me.
I was asking about the accident.
Pulse is strong but elevated. BP's good.
Right and left ankles are broken.
One for each wife?
He's lucky that's all he's broken.
(<em>groans</em>)
Left ankle's got an open fracture.
We're gonna give you something for the pain.
(<em>groaning</em>)
Ravi? How's the driver?
Working on it. You sure you're not injured, sir?
No! I'm fine!
How about you come outside and just let me check you for injuries, just to be safe?
Nope.
Safer in here.
Does he have any allergies or underlying medical conditions that my team should be aware of?
Not that I know of. But I didn't know about her, either.
This feels like a lot to keep track of.
Two rings, two phones, and two Christmases.
Sometimes it can make your brain hurt.
Is it hurting right now?
Have any headaches, blurred vision, sensitivity to light?
I did hit my head.
Maybe I could fake amnesia.
Buy some time to help me figure this out.
Yeah. I, uh, I would say your bigger problem is making them forget.
Everything he said to me is a lie.
I'd almost feel bad for you if you hadn't married my husband.
(<em>scoffs</em>)
Wait. How old are your boys?
Eight and seven.
Oh, God.
I'm married to her husband.
I'm wife number two, Arthur?!
Please tell me he's ready to transport.
Both ankles are broken pretty badly and I think he's got a compound fracture, but I don't see any major swelling or pooling of blood.
His vitals are steady.
Roll him on three?
One, two, three.

One, two, three.
Okay, let's roll.

You know, you could at least appear a little more upset about missing Christmas with your family.
Come on, Mom.
It's not like this is the first holiday one of us in the family had to work.
It's just my turn this year.
Remember when we used to open presents on Christmas Eve?
Stay up all night. That was the best.
<strong>Athena</strong>: You know, speaking of gifts, did you want to open any this year?
I still haven't seen your Christmas list.
Well, I already told you what I want.
Cash is not an acceptable Christmas present, not in this house.
(<em>snorts</em>)
I will also be accepting gift cards.
I want to buy something that's put in a box and gift wrapped.
You can wrap cash.
Pretty sure you can think of something that isn't cash or a cash equivalent. Right?
Mm-hmm.
I guess.
(<em>sighs</em>)
Oh, um, I-I gotta head out.
I'll drop off my presents tomorrow, okay?
All right. Have a good day at work.
Thank you. Bye. Bye.
Okay.
That sounds festive.

Maybe we can invite the UPS driver for Christmas.
I think he might be more invested in the holiday.

<strong>Carla</strong>: <em>What's wrong with the tree?</em>
Everything, apparently.
It was facing the wrong way, he didn't like the way I was stringing the lights, and I was putting the ornaments in the wrong places.
I felt like I was being judged by Martha Stewart.

You know, becoming his own person.
Forming his own opinions.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

It was about Mom.
So if you'd like to make a donation, you can drop off new, unwrapped toys or sports equipment to any fire station across Los Angeles.

<strong>Buck</strong>: She's a hard woman to shop for.
You still haven't bought her anything?
You're running out of shopping days, bud.
Well, it's not that simple.
You know, I've never had to get a Christmas present for a girlfriend before.
Aw.
It's baby's first Christmas in a serious relationship.
I used to have this roommate who'd always break up with his girlfriend right after Halloween.
Now I know why. It's too much pressure.
Hi.
Hi.
What did you get Athena for your first Christmas?
An engagement ring.
Oh. No. Not doing that.
No, don't overthink it, Buck.
Just get her something sweet, something she could use but that she wouldn't necessarily buy for herself.
Get her something that lets her know that you know her really well.
Okay, you've just added way too many parameters to this equation. What I was thinking...
Portable generator.
Uh, useful in case of emergency and not something that she would buy for herself.
Someone's gonna be single by New Year's.
It's a good idea.
It's not.

Ma'am what's your name?
<em>Phyllis. Phyllis Lang.</em>
Hello, Phyllis, I think we've spoken before.
Many times.
<em>Have we?</em>
My memory's so bad these days.
<em>My records show</em> that you've called us over a dozen times in the last five years.
Including yesterday.
And you people have been so kind to me.
Answering my calls <em>no matter what time of day or night.</em>
Phyllis, are you experiencing an actual emergency?
Do I need to call my firefighters?
I wouldn't mind seeing some firefighters.
They're-they're always so nice.
<em>Yes, but</em> is there a fire they need to put out?
Or did you forget to change the batteries in your smoke detector? Again?
<em>Oh, right.</em>
I'm supposed to do that, aren't I?
Twice a year, ma'am.
They make ones you can hardwire.
Well, that sounds complicated.
Do the firefighters do that?
You-you probably need to call an electrician.
What a good idea. Do you know of any?
Ma'am, there are resources for senior citizens.
If you need someone to talk to, <em>I suggest that you...</em>
I am talking to someone. You.
This is not what 911 is for.
You're tying up our resources and...
<em>I'm sorry.</em>
You're very busy. I can call back later.
No! Wait.
(<em>sighs</em>)
(<em>exhales</em>)
She's back.
(<em>typing</em>)
So what did the doctor say?
That one nightmare isn't necessarily a reason for concern.
(<em>sighs</em>) Could be an isolated incident.
But...
What?
I don't think it's an isolated anything.
He's been obsessed with the holidays this year.
How everything has to be perfect.
Now he's waking up screaming, dreaming of his mother?
Shannon came back at Christmas, right?
You think that's what triggered it?
Well, the holidays were always their thing.
You know, cookies and stockings and gingerbread houses.
Maybe I'm not doing it right.
(<em>sighs</em>)
He-he misses his mom.
That-That's not your fault.
So much for the most wonderful time of the year.
Yeah.
It's a real pressure cooker.
<strong>Pam</strong>: Well, he still cheated on you.
<strong>Bree</strong>: Oh, at least I came first.
How does it feel to be runner-up?
You boys really needed to call 911 for this?
I tried several de-escalation techniques.
I talked to them. In a neutral, non-judgmental tone.
Requested they keep their voices down or move their conversation to a private area.
Then this one took a swing at me.
I wasn't aiming for you. You just got in the way.
<strong>Bree</strong>: (<em>laughs</em>) I have no idea what Artie ever saw in you.
You are so crass and volatile.
Maybe he was tired of this Zen earth mother schtick you've got going on.
I've known you for five minutes, already I'm bored to tears.
All right, so you two are the wives.
Polygamists.
It's not polygamy.
We didn't choose to be married to the same man.
I can't wait to never see this woman again.
Same.
Hey, hey, hey!
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you two are stuck with each other.
You got kids, right?
(<em>sighs</em>) Two boys.
One girl.
Siblings.
So whatever anger or hurt feelings you're experiencing right now... However justified...
You've got to figure out a way to put those aside for their sake.
This is a real confusing time for them right now.
And they've already got a part-time father.
They don't need a long-distance mother doing three to six.
Seven years of lying to my face.
I never even suspected.
I did.
Not another family.
But there were times when I thought that there might be someone else.
And you never confronted him?
I always told myself it didn't matter.
Not as long as I was the one he came home to.
But it turns out I'm not even special in that way.
I wasn't good enough for him.
No.
He's the one who isn't good enough.
For either of us.
We deserve better.
Still want to press charges?
Just get 'em out of my hospital.
Happy holidays.
Stop. Stop. Back up.
Mr. Darcola?
Are you here to arrest me?
Not today.
But bigamy is still a crime in all 50 states.
You might want to ask Santa for a lawyer.
Ladies? We good?
So... uh... what happens now?
<strong>Both</strong>: We want a divorce.
But it's Christmas.
That's right, ladies.
Fight the real enemy.

That's me.
Oh.
I'm really sorry about the present.
And what happened after.
You got him a Christmas present?

Tickets to the philharmonic, and I totally freaked out.

What did you say?
Wasn't sure what to say.
I told him that I loved him, and I promised him that I wasn't going anywhere.
But?
One of the first things they teach you on the job is to never make a promise you're not sure you can keep.
You were trying to reassure your son, who's already lost one parent, that he's not about to lose another.
Bullets don't bounce off me, Carla.
I learned that the hard way.
You still thinking about that?
Now and then.

But it did remind me that what I do is not without risk.
Okay, I can't lie.
I wish your biggest danger at work was you getting a paper cut.
But I know that your job is important.
Not just to the people you save but to you.
But is it more important than my kid feeling safe when he closes his eyes at night?

<strong>Sue</strong>: Well, and newer dispatchers wind up rolling out help because they don't know any better.
She said there was a gas leak.
I sent two houses plus police and the gas company.
Evacuated a five-block radius.
Which would absolutely have been the right call had there been an actual gas leak.
Is it some kind of holiday prank?
I think she just wants someone to talk to.
Bonus if she manages to engineer a visit from some first responders.
Or 33 of them.
Oh.
<strong>Linda</strong>: Look, I'm sorry she doesn't have any family, but two firehouses.
<strong>Sue</strong>: Well, I think she does, but they just don't talk anymore.

Yeah.
Mind if I come in?

Would you like something to drink?
No, thank you. This is not a social call, Phyllis.

I came to talk some sense into you.

Oh, I wouldn't know what to say.
Start with &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;

(<em>alarm chiming</em>)
<strong>Hugo</strong>: Ah, damn it!
<em>Why's your car beeping?</em>
Because these freaking sensors are too sensitive.
(<em>beeping slows down</em>)
(<em>beeping speeds up</em>)
What was that?
Oh. my God!
<strong>Leandra</strong>: Please, you got to help us. Please.
My husband's in there. We can't get to him.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Okay, everybody step back.
Okay, looks like he hit this post and took some of the structure down with it.
I don't understand how this happened.
We were on the phone arguing over the Christmas tree, and then all of a sudden, this comes crashing down.
You said you were on the phone with him?
Yes.
Has he said anything since the collapse?
No.
He just stopped talking.
Okay, Buck, Eddie, Hen, I want you to start clearing this debris carefully.
Everybody else, step back, give us some room to work.
<strong>Ravi</strong>: Where do you need me, Cap?
I need you evacuating this building.
I'm concerned it's gonna come crashing down any minute.
These structures were supposed to be retrofitted after the Northridge quake, but from the looks of things, landlord didn't get around to it.
Do the residents know that?
They're about to find out.
Cap, he's unconscious, possibly not breathing.
Is he dead? Is Dad dead?
<strong>Leandra</strong>: Come here, sweetie. They're gonna get him out.
Come here.
We're ready, Cap. Airbag is in place.
Okay, let's lift it nice and slow.
We need just enough space between the car and the ceiling to pop that door and pull him out.
(<em>whirring</em>)
<strong>Buck</strong>: Okay, that should do it. Eddie, go.
(<em>whirring stops</em>)
Cap, he's coming around!
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Okay, that's good news. Let's get a collar on him and put him on a board.
All right, bud. Hey. That's good.
You got him?
Got you. We got you.
Let's get him on the gurney.
<strong>Hen</strong>: Slowly. Slowly.
Keep him stable. Watch the neck.
Pressure's slightly elevated, probably from the pain, but we can't rule out internal injuries.
Let's start a line.
Watch his legs.
Pupils are reacting but sluggish, likely a concussion.
He's gonna be okay.
Thank God.
Hugo.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: So, they'll check him out at the hospital for anything that's going on internally.
But you and your son can ride with him in the ambulance.
<strong>Leandra</strong>: Thank you so much.
I don't know what I would have done if anything had happened to him.
You saved our Christmas.
What?
After they discharge your husband from the hospital, you still can't come back here.
I'm gonna have to red-tag the building.
But Christmas is tomorrow.
I know, and I'm sorry.
It's just not safe to go back in there.

We have to red-tag the building.
I know tomorrow's Christmas, but it's just not safe to go back in there.
I have notified the Red Cross.
A representative is on the way.
They will be providing housing for you and your families until your building can get sorted out.
Very sorry.

Mm.
Stuck in a motel room.
No tree. No presents.
Hey. It's okay.
We're alive and we're together and that's all that matters, right?
