Come on, pick up, Arthur.
<i>Hi, this is Arthur.</i> <i>-Leave a message.</i> Hey, hon, it's me.
Not sure if you're in the air yet, but we're about to see Santa.
So I thought maybe we could FaceTime.
I know Elise would love to see her daddy.
So would I. Love you.
No Mr. Darcola?
Probably about to take off.
I'm just glad we get him on the actual day this year.
The holidays are always less fun when he's working.
It must be hard that he's away so much.
Wife of a pilot.
At least I get him every other Christmas.
Daddy!
No, sweetie, we're gonna see Santa Claus.
Daddy, Daddy.
Arthur?
Artie?
 Dad?
 Daddy.
 You two-timing son of a...<i>-Perro.</i> Uh...I can...
Uh...
 Excuse me, excuse me.
 Whoa!
Oh, hell no!
 Uh...
 Watch out!
 Excuse me.

 I don't have to prove anything. I don't even know who you are.
Artie has never even mentioned you.
I think Artie hasn't talked about a lot of things.
 Ain't that right, Artie? What do we think?
Some kind of road rage incident? Or trolley rage?
Definitely sensing some kind of rage.
Hey, Ravi, you go check on the driver.
Buck and Eddie, you're gonna handle this victim.
Okay, we've got an injured man down on the ground.
Let's give the officers a break.
Can one of you tell me what happened?
This woman is having an affair with my husband.
This woman is lying.
He is my husband. I have a ring and everything.
My husband is wearing a matching one.
You can check it if you don't believe me.
I was asking about the accident.
Pulse is strong but elevated. BP's good.
Right and left ankles are broken.
One for each wife?
He's lucky that's all he's broken.
Left ankle's got an open fracture.
We're gonna give you something for the pain.
Ravi? How's the driver?
Working on it. You sure you're not injured, sir?
No! I'm fine!
How about you come outside and just let me check you for injuries, just to be safe?
Nope.
Safer in here.
Does he have any allergies or underlying medical conditions that my team should be aware of?
Not that I know of. But I didn't know about her, either.
This feels like a lot to keep track of.
Two rings, two phones, and two Christmases.
Sometimes it can make your brain hurt.
Is it hurting right now?
Have any headaches, blurred vision, sensitivity to light?
I did hit my head.
Maybe I could fake amnesia.
Buy some time to help me figure this out.
Yeah. I, uh, I would say your bigger problem is making them forget.
Everything he said to me is a lie.
I'd almost feel bad for you if you hadn't married my husband.
Wait. How old are your boys?
Eight and seven.
Oh, God.
I'm married to her husband.
I'm wife number two, Arthur?!
Please tell me he's ready to transport.
Both ankles are broken pretty badly and I think he's got a compound fracture, but I don't see any major swelling or pooling of blood.
His vitals are steady.
Roll him on three?
One, two, three.
Okay, sir, I'm gonna need you to sign this document saying that you refused medical treatment.
One, two, three.
Okay, let's roll.
<i>♪ Anxious care is now but folly</i> ♪ * <i>Fa, la, la...</i> *  Keep him stable.
Love you! I love you both!
We can work this out!
 Where are you taking him? First Presbyterian.
Do either one of you want to go with him?
Happy holidays.
What do you think?
It's facing the wrong way.
There's a right way?
The skinny side should face the window.
What skinny...
Okay. Yes, boss.
There, that's it.
All right.
We are ready for ornaments.
I see bare spots.
How many lights were you thinking?
Just keep comin'.
That's a lot of lights.
No. Five popcorns. One cranberry.
Is that some kind of rule?
Yes.
Looks great.
We need tinsel. Some sparkle.
Okay.
That's enough decorating for tonight.
Why don't you go, uh, go get ready for bed?
I'll finish up. You can critique my work in the morning.
I just want everything to be perfect.
Oh. Uh...
it will, bud.
All right, come on.
All right.
Night, Dad.
Night, bud.
<i>♪ With every shroud of falling snow</i> ♪ <i>♪ Bring back some precious memory</i> ♪ Do we even have tinsel?
<i>I'm wishing ♪</i> <i>For an old-fashioned...♪</i> Turkey, ham, and a roast?
Well, we're hosting so many people.
I figured, better have too much than not enough.
Well, we're gonna be two less this year without Michael and David.
Oh, three less.
Don't forget I won't be here for dinner, either.
Can't believe you actually wanted to work on Christmas.
That's way worse than all those extra credit projects you used to do in school.
But it pays better. Time and a half better.
Does it make up for missing my mac and cheese?
You'll save me a plate.
Or maybe an entire turkey?
Well, I'm roasting that one. I'm gonna deep-fry this one.
Ooh! Is it gonna explode?
 If I let you cook it.
You know, you could at least appear a little more upset about missing Christmas with your family.
Come on, Mom.
It's not like this is the first holiday one of us in the family had to work.
It's just my turn this year.
Remember when we used to open presents on Christmas Eve?
Stay up all night. That was the best.
You know, speaking of gifts, did you want to open any this year?
I still haven't seen your Christmas list.
Well, I already told you what I want.
Cash is not an acceptable Christmas present,  not in this house.
I will also be accepting gift cards.
I want to buy something that's put in a box  and gift wrapped.
 You can wrap cash.
Pretty sure you can think of something that isn't cash  or a cash equivalent. Right?
 Mm-hmm.
I guess.
 Oh, um, I-I gotta head out.
I'll drop off my presents tomorrow, okay?
All right. Have a good day at work.
 Thank you. Bye. Bye.
 Okay.
That sounds festive.
Bye.
Maybe we can invite the UPS driver for Christmas.
I think he might be more invested in the holiday.
<i>What's wrong with the tree?</i> Everything, apparently.
It was facing the wrong way, he didn't like the way I was stringing the lights, and I was putting the ornaments in the wrong places.
I felt like I was being judged by Martha Stewart.
Pre-Snoop Dogg.
Well, he's growing up.
You know, becoming his own person.
Forming his own opinions.
About the proper popcorn-to-cranberry ratio of garland?
It's five-to-one, just in case you were wondering.
Well, of course it is.
Anything else would be madness.
 Is that Christopher?
 Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Are you okay?
 I'm fine.
 We heard you screaming.
What happened? Did you have a bad dream?
You want to talk about it?
Sometimes talking about it makes it less scary.
It was about Mom.
So if you'd like to make a donation, you can drop off new, unwrapped toys or sports equipment to any fire station across Los Angeles.
They'll be accepting donations through Christmas Eve.
Back to you, Margaret.
She's a hard woman to shop for.
You still haven't bought her anything?
You're running out of shopping days, bud.
Well, it's not that simple.
You know, I've never had to get a Christmas present for a girlfriend before.
Aw.
It's baby's first Christmas in a serious relationship.
I used to have this roommate who'd always break up with his girlfriend right after Halloween.
Now I know why. It's too much pressure.
 Hi.
 Hi.
What did you get Athena for your first Christmas?
An engagement ring.
Oh. No. Not doing that.
No, don't overthink it, Buck.
Just get her something sweet, something she could use but that she wouldn't necessarily buy for herself.
Get her something that lets her know that you know her really well.
Okay, you've just added way too many parameters to this equation. What I was thinking...
Portable generator.
Uh, useful in case of emergency and not something that she would buy for herself.
Someone's gonna be single by New Year's.
It's a good idea.
 It's not.
 It's a good idea.
Cap...
Taylor. Thanks for the coverage.
Helps boost our donations.
Happy I could help.
Maybe you could help with something.
 I have a question.
 What, about your story?
I thought that was all covered.
Uh...
<i>Glory to...♪</i> Do you think Buck would like one of these sweaters?
<i>The newborn king. ♪</i> Oh, no, dearie.
It's just me. I live alone.
<i>Do you know what part of the house</i> <i>the fire is currently burning?</i> Um...I can't really tell.
<i>I just hear the beeping.</i> Ma'am what's your name?
<i>Phyllis. Phyllis Lang.</i> Hello, Phyllis, I think we've spoken before.
 Many times. <i>-Have we?</i> My memory's so bad these days.
<i>My records show</i> that you've called us over a dozen times in the last five years.
Including yesterday.
And you people have been so kind to me.
Answering my calls <i>no matter what time of day or night.</i> Phyllis, are you experiencing an actual emergency?
Do I need to call my firefighters?
I wouldn't mind seeing some firefighters.
They're-they're always so nice.
<i>Yes, but</i> is there a fire they need to put out?
Or did you forget to change the batteries in your smoke detector? Again?
<i>Oh, right.</i> I'm supposed to do that, aren't I?
Twice a year, ma'am.
They make ones you can hardwire.
Well, that sounds complicated.
Do the firefighters do that?
You-you probably need to call an electrician.
What a good idea. Do you know of any?
Ma'am, there are resources for senior citizens.
If you need someone to talk to, <i>-I suggest that you...</i>  I am talking to someone. You.
This is not what 911 is for.
You're tying up our resources and...
<i>I'm sorry.</i> You're very busy. I can call back later.
No! Wait.
 She's back.
So what did the doctor say?
That one nightmare isn't necessarily a reason for concern.
Could be an isolated incident.
But...
What?
I don't think it's an isolated anything.
He's been obsessed with the holidays this year.
How everything has to be perfect.
Now he's waking up screaming, dreaming of his mother?
Shannon came back at Christmas, right?
You think that's what triggered it?
Well, the holidays were always their thing.
You know, cookies and stockings and gingerbread houses.
Maybe I'm not doing it right.
He-he misses his mom.
That-That's not your fault.
So much for the most wonderful time of the year.
Yeah.
It's a real pressure cooker.
Well, he still cheated on you.
Oh, at least I came first.
How does it feel to be runner-up?
You boys really needed to call 911 for this?
I tried several de-escalation techniques.
I talked to them. In a neutral, non-judgmental tone.
Requested they keep their voices down or move their conversation to a private area.
Then this one took a swing at me.
I wasn't aiming for you. You just got in the way.
I have no idea what Artie ever saw in you.
You are so crass and volatile.
Maybe he was tired of this Zen earth mother schtick you've got going on.
I've known you for five minutes, already  I'm bored to tears.
 All right, so you two  are the wives.
 Polygamists.
It's not polygamy.
We didn't choose to be married to the same man.
I can't wait to never see this woman again.
 Same.
 Hey, hey, hey!
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you two are stuck with each other.
You got kids, right?
Two boys.
One girl.
Siblings.
So whatever anger or hurt feelings you're experiencing right now -- however justified -- you've got to figure out a way to put those aside for their sake.
This is a real confusing time for them right now.
And they've already got a part-time father.
They don't need a long-distance mother doing three to six.
Seven years of lying to my face.
I never even suspected.
I did.
Not another family.
But there were times when I thought that there might be someone else.
And you never confronted him?
I always told myself it didn't matter.
Not as long as I was the one he came home to.
But it turns out I'm not even special in that way.
I wasn't good enough for him.
No.
He's the one who isn't good enough.
For either of us.
We deserve better.
Still want to press charges?
Just get 'em out of my hospital.
Happy holidays.
Stop. Stop. Back up.
Mr. Darcola?
Are you here to arrest me?
Not today.
But bigamy is still a crime in all 50 states.
You might want to ask Santa for a lawyer.
Ladies? We good?
So...uh...
what happens now?
We want a divorce.
But it's Christmas.
That's right, ladies.

And you seem to really love the philharmonic because you go to all those concerts.
So I thought, a Christmas sing-along?
We could go together.
We could even make it a date.
Oh.
Melia...
You have plans, don't you?
No, i...
it's not that. I...
You're not interested.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked you.
I...I didn't mean to cross the line.
I'm...I'm just gonna go.
 Melia! Wait!
 Aah!
Melia!
Oh, my gosh. Melia!
How's she doing, Hen?
She seems to be breathing steadily, Cap.
Okay, Buck, power's been cut. Go ahead and tie it off.
Okay, cable is secure.
This thing's not going anywhere.
Looks like just some minor lacerations.
No sign of blood pooling.
 What happened?
 You took a tumble.
Down an open elevator shaft.
Do you mind explaining how that happened?
We were talking, and she got upset  and tried to run, and then...
 Well, which brings us back to what the hell were you doing with this elevator?
 Fixing it?
 No safety cones. No caution tape.
No signage.
Okay, why don't you and I find someplace where we can have a conversation about proper elevator maintenance  and safety protocols. Let's go. Pupillary responses are equal and reactive.
Reactive.
That's me.
Oh.
I'm really sorry about the present.
And what happened after.
 You got him a Christmas present?
 I tried to.
Tickets to the philharmonic, and I totally freaked out.
Look, I am the one who should be apologizing.
 The tickets kind of triggered me.
 Concert tickets off the list.
 You still haven't figured that out? I've been, uh, weighing up some options.
I'm looking forward to seeing Taylor's reaction to whatever it is on Christmas.
Uh, hey, hey, so, so, what? She's, uh, she just  not your type or...
 Oh, no, she's amazing.
I just hate the philharmonic.
Uh, but-but you go to all those concerts.
Because my ex played the piccolo.
And then she left me for the second trombone.
Ouch.
Does it hurt when I do that?
Everything hurts right now.
I would've said yes.
If it had been anything else, I would have said yes.
 Truth is I've had a crush on you for months.
Oh, you have?
I just didn't know how to tell you.
 Ah, sounds like you guys have more in common than you thought.
Yeah.
 Ow. Ow.
 Sorry.
They're gonna get you to the ER, do some scans, and hopefully, you'll be home for Christmas.
 Can I?
 Go.
Uh, hey, Hen?
About Christmas.
I think me and Taylor are just gonna hang out at my place.
You're gonna bail on Bobby and Athena's holiday extravaganza?
I don't feel all that merry this year.
You know? And I don't want to ruin everyone else's day 'cause I-I'm...
Missing the rest of your family?
Yeah. Me too.
* <i>Silent night...</i> *  Dad.
It's finished.
Okay. I made some hot chocolate  to celebrate the end of construction!
 No!
 Uh...
 My house!
It's ruined!
<i>All is bright...♪</i> Um, maybe we can fix it, okay?
It's ruined.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay. We'll make another one. All right? I'll help.
There's no time. It's almost Christmas.
And you're working tomorrow.
What is going on?
Okay? Seems like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to get Christmas right.
Where is this coming from, Chris?
I wanted everything to be perfect.
 You, me, presents and-and stockings.
That sounds pretty good to me, right?
 Hey. Okay, we'll make an even bigger gingerbread house next year, right?
You could be dead next year.
What did you say?
Wasn't sure what to say.
I told him that I loved him, and I promised him that I wasn't going anywhere.
But?
One of the first things they teach you on the job is to never make a promise you're not sure you can keep.
You were trying to reassure your son, who's already lost one parent, that he's not about to lose another.
Bullets don't bounce off me, Carla.
I learned that the hard way.
You still thinking about that?
Now and then.
 Like when I get taken hostage at gunpoint.
 You what?
Happened a few weeks back.
You know, Buck and I got caught up in that prison escape.
Neither of us got hurt, so I didn't see a point in telling you or him.
 But it did remind me that what I do is not without risk.
Okay, I can't lie.
I wish your biggest danger at work was you getting a paper cut.
But I know that your job is important.
Not just to the people you save but to you.
But is it more important than my kid feeling safe when he closes his eyes at night?
Eddie just canceled.
 He and Christopher won't be joining us for Christmas.
That's what, our fifth cancellation?
And we were already working with a limited guest list.
I know.
 This is not the Christmas I thought we'd be having.
 Yeah.
Looks like it's just the Grant-Nashes  and the Wilsons this year.
 What?
Clive surprised Toni with a trip to Cabo, and Hen says that now they're thinking about just going to Karen's family instead this year.
Okay. Well, this is getting depressing.
Are we forcing this?
Throwing some big holiday party to distract us from the people we're missing?
There's still you, me and Harry.
And that's probably all we need.
Mm.
51 Orangethorpe Avenue.
<i>Ma'am, what is the nature of your emergency?</i> <i>-Well...</i>  Mrs. Lang, do you have any reasonable fear <i>that your life r the life of someone you knowo</i> <i>may be in imminent danger?</i> I d-I don't know think I'd go that far.
Then I'm going to have to hang up now.
Happy holidays.
Goodbye.
Wow.
This is a lot of decorations.
Working Christmas Day with Sue is always epic.
Well, there is no such thing as too many twinkle lights.
Lonely Lady called again.
You cannot be serious.
 Mm.
 I got her yesterday.
Lonely Lady?
Our holiday frequent flyer.
She calls every year reporting some sort of emergency  that isn't really an emergency. Well, and newer dispatchers wind up rolling out help because they don't know any better.
She said there was a gas leak.
I sent two houses plus police and the gas company.
Evacuated a five-block radius.
Which would absolutely have been the right call had there been  an actual gas leak.
 Is it some kind of holiday prank?
I think she just wants someone to talk to.
Bonus if she manages to engineer a visit from some first responders.
Or 33 of them.
 Oh. Look, I'm sorry she doesn't have any family, but two firehouses.
Well, I think she does, but they just don't talk anymore.
You know, kids grow up, and sometimes they grow away, too.
Guess we got to call her again.
Give her our annual "stop calling 911" speech.
No.
I think this time we need a stronger deterrent.
 Oh.
 Phyllis Lang?
 Yeah.
 Mind if I come in?
Oh. They sent the police this time.
Would you like something to drink?
No, thank you. This is not a social call, Phyllis.
Misuse of 911 is a crime.
Oh, God.
You came here to...to arrest me?
I came to talk some sense into you.
Is there really no one else that you can call besides a 911 dispatcher? Your family?
Or a therapist?
Only family I have is my daughter.
We-we don't speak much.
My husband -- he-he was, uh, the-the glue that held us together.
Then after he died, I-I guess I figured I had to be the glue, but I-I didn't have his knack for it.
Tighter I tried to hold on, the...further she slipped away.
I have a daughter, too.
And a mother.
Moms and their girls, always complicated.
Things haven't been the same between us since her-her wedding day.
I may have said that I hated her husband and it was never gonna last.
They're married for 12 years.
Two kids.
 Have you tried apologizing to her?
 Oh, I wouldn't know what to say.
Start with "I'm sorry." Go from there.
She doesn't need me anymore.
Last 12 years have proved that.
That doesn't mean she wouldn't like to hear from you.
May be time for you to dial a different number.
Ooh!
 Found everything.
Except for the star that goes on top.
I think it's in one of the storage cabinets down by the parking space.
I'm gonna ask your dad to look for it when he gets home with the tree.
What about the wreath?
It's in here somewhere.
Hey. You better be close.
Yeah, I'm just pulling in.
Hey, I-I think I need you to come help me with this thing.
<i>It's a little bigger than we normally get.</i> How big?
Uh, bigger.
Hugo, that thing better fit in this apartment. We never get  a big tree.
 Is that Dad?
Well, it's all they had left.
The big daddies or the dried out, skimpy ones.
You know, if you had come with me like I asked you to, <i>we could have picked something out together.</i> If someone would have come with me last Saturday like I wanted, <i>this wouldn't be happening, but someone</i> <i>was too busy watching football.-</i> Hey, thank you, sweetheart.
It was my alma mater and the biggest game of the year.
<i>-And they lost.</i> Oh, and we can't find the star.
I think it's in the storage locker.
Ah, damn it!
<i>Why's your car beeping?</i> Because these freaking sensors are too sensitive.
What was that?
Oh. my God!
Please, you got to help us. Please.
My husband's in there. We can't get to him.
Okay, everybody step back.
Okay, looks like he hit this post and took some of the structure down with it.
I don't understand how this happened.
We were on the phone arguing over the Christmas tree, and then all of a sudden, this comes crashing down.
You said you were on the phone with him?
 Yes.
 Has he said anything  since the collapse?
 No.
He just stopped talking.
Okay, Buck, Eddie, Hen, I want you to start clearing this debris carefully.
Everybody else, step back,  give us some room to work. Where do you need me,  Cap?
 I need you evacuating this building.
I'm concerned it's gonna come crashing down any minute.
These structures were supposed to be retrofitted after the Northridge quake, but from the looks of things, landlord didn't get around to it.
Do the residents know that?
They're about to find out.
Cap, he's unconscious, possibly not breathing.
Is he dead? Is Dad dead?
Come here, sweetie. They're gonna get him out.
Come here.
We're ready, Cap. Airbag is in place.
Okay, let's lift it nice and slow.
We need just enough space between the car and the ceiling to pop that door and pull him out.
Okay, that should do it. Eddie, go.
Cap, he's coming around!
Okay, that's good news. Let's get a collar on him and put him on a board.
All right, bud. Hey. That's good.
You got him?
Got you. We got you.
Let's get him on the gurney.
Slowly. Slowly.
Keep him stable. Watch the neck.
Pressure's slightly elevated, probably from the pain, but we can't rule out internal injuries.
Let's start a line.
Watch his legs.
Pupils are reacting but sluggish, likely a concussion.
 He's gonna be okay.
 Thank God.
Hugo.
So, they'll check him out at the hospital for anything that's going on internally.
But you and your son can ride with him in the ambulance.
Thank you so much.
I don't know what I would have done if anything had happened to him.
You saved our Christmas.
What?
After they discharge your husband from the hospital, you still can't come back here.
I'm gonna have to red-tag the building.
But Christmas is tomorrow.
I know, and I'm sorry.
It's just not safe to go back in there.
We have to red-tag the building.
I know tomorrow's Christmas, but it's just not safe to go back in there.
I have notified the Red Cross.
A representative is on the way.
They will be providing housing for you and your families until your building can get sorted out.
Very sorry.
We're really gonna leave them, Cap?
There's nothing else we can do.
Whoa.
Told you.
 You weren't kidding.
 Yeah.
Oh, my God. It's epic.
What?
It's Christmas.
I think this is the first Christmas he hasn't been up at the crack of dawn.
Maybe it doesn't feel like Christmas to him, either.
 Mm.
 Stuck in a motel room.
No tree. No presents.
Hey. It's okay.
We're alive and we're together and that's all that matters, right?
I guess.
Hi.
I'm not sure if you remember me.
You're the firefighter.
You saved my husband.
Yeah.
 What are you doing here?
 Why don't you guys come on outside.
I think Santa found us.
Yeah, I think he did.
Oh, wow.

 Uh, not just any bracelet.
This one has an emergency distress beacon in it.
You got me something  that tracks my whereabouts 24-7.
 It's, uh, it's not a tracker. Right? It's-it's a beacon.
So it only deploys when you press it.
Earthquake, fire, flood.
Whatever it is, you hit that button, and we will come to your rescue.
<i>Oh, I wish I had a river...♪</i> That's so sweet.
 I got you a sweater.
 It's in the car.
 Hey.
I already love it.
Really?
Merry Christmas.

You too.
Here. Let me grab this. Thank you.
Uh, where's Karen?
She's on her way.
She packed up the car with so many donations, there was no room for me or Denny.
How you doing?
Still feeling less than merry?
I'm, uh...I'm okay.
You know, sure, we're...
we're missing some people today, but, hey, I'm thankful for the ones we do have.
<i>Joy and peace, oh, I wish...♪</i>  Merry Christmas, Buck.
 Merry Christmas.
Where's Eddie?
<i>Away on. ♪</i> Huh.
Wonder what that's about.
I don't know.
But I don't like it.
Sorry, I don't want to take you guys away from the party.
I just had some news that I don't want you to hear from anyone else.
H-Hold on. First, you're having this deep, intense conversation with Bobby.
Now you gather us here for some announcement?
 What's going on?
 Is everything okay with Christopher?
He's worried about me.
About the risks I take  while I'm at work. Wow.
That's a lot for a ten-year-old to be thinking about.
Yeah. Probably too much.
So I think I have to make a change.
I'm leaving the 118.
