I was a 12-year-old Korean boy translating to the doctor on behalf of my sick mother.
Makes you wonder how bad it is for a patient who doesn't have anyone, no one to advocate for them.
That's why people like you and me can't put all our trust in doctors.

(<em>Laughs softly</em>) That feels like a leap.
You haven't even met her.
No, but I found some weird stuff online.
I think she lied to you.
About what?
<strong>Carla</strong>: <em>That's a lot of Fund Me pages.</em>
There's Sheila and Charlie Burns in El Paso, Sheila and Charlie Young in Phoenix, and Sheila and Charlie Watts of Santa Fe.
It's him, the same kid every time, just with different last names and different cities.
Charlie did say they moved around a lot.
That would explain the different accounts and different cities, but not the different names.
What did his mom say his illness was?
(<em>Laughs softly</em>) She didn't. Not really.
Said it was autoimmune.
Well, that's awfully general.
Charlie did say he goes to a lot of different doctors.
Could be doctor shopping.
Which is what you do when you're not really sick, you're just looking for a doctor to say that you are.
You think she's lying?
Well, we wouldn't be the only ones.
Most of the Fund Me pages were shut down, but the comments are still up.
&quot;This woman is a fraud and a scammer.
Do not trust her&quot;.
&quot;She's a con artist looking for money and attention&quot;.
Oh, God.
<strong>Carla</strong>: What?
&quot;I think she's making her kid sick&quot;.
Oh, you didn't have to do dishes.
You cooked.
Well, that's okay.
What do you say, you want to watch a movie?
May is out and Harry's at Michael's.
We could have a date night in.
Um, rain check?
I just had a really long day, I think I got to crash.
Hmm. Is everything okay?
I mean, if something's bothering you, if something's on your mind, you know you can talk to me.
Everything is fine.
Nothing to talk about.
It doesn't feel fine.
I'm worried about you.
Athena, I'm...
I know you have your meetings, and I'm glad you have people that you can talk to.
But you can talk to me, too.
Yeah, I know, it's... the meetings... not the same.
Yeah, I know.
I can never really understand that part of your life, but I'd like to try.
Maybe I can go with you to your meeting?
You have one tomorrow, right?
That is very sweet of you, but no.
I-I don't have one tomorrow, but you could come on Saturday.
Great.
Good, okay. Good night.
(<em>Athena exhales</em>)
<strong>Hen</strong>: I'm fine, Karen. You, you stay there.
I'll call you when I have an update.
You're still here?
You didn't, you didn't have to.
It's your mom.
Thank you.
For everything.
(<em>Door opens</em>)
<strong>Sydney</strong>: Hen.
<strong>Surgeon</strong>: Ms. Wilson?
Good news.
(<em>Laughs softly</em>)
Hey, Ma. How you feeling?
A little sore... but a lot grateful.
The surgeon did a good job.
You're gonna make a full recovery, Ma.
I'm glad to hear that.
But it's not the doctor I'm grateful for.
You saved my life.
(<em>Laughs softly</em>)
Well, the truth is, I got used to having you around.
So I'm not ready to let you go just yet.
I won't be around forever, Henrietta.
Ma...
I won't.
So let me say this.
I am so proud of you.
Henrietta, you... working so hard and going to school, taking care of your family.
I know it's a struggle.
But it is worth it.
Because people like me?
We need doctors like you.
So, promise me... no matter how hard it gets, you won't give up.
You promise?
I promise.
Guess B shift's still out on a call.
<strong>Buck</strong>: Damn.
You're early.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Couldn't sleep.
You remember the mom the other day? Sheila?
With the sick kid?
<strong>Both</strong>: Yeah.
He's not sick. Not really.
She's making him sick. Probably for years.
Munchausen by proxy? That's a big accusation, Eddie.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: I tracked down some people that knew them before.
All signs point to it.
The nonspecific autoimmune disease, the revolving door of doctors.
He's frail, he's weak, he's always throwing up.
She's poisoning him.
Poisoning him? W-With what?
Eye drops. I saw them in the kitchen.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Eye drops. Tetrahydrozoline could cause the symptoms that you're talking about.
It can be lethal if it's ingested, doesn't show up on a standard toxicology test.
You have to know to look for it to find it.
She's dosing him.
Not enough to kill him but enough to keep him sick.
I called social services.
They're coming here to take a report.
Why-why would she do that?
Well, sometimes it's to gain sympathy.
Oh, or maybe to make a profit.
I found multiple Fund Me pages.
She's conning people out of their money.
(<em>Phone vibrating, ringing</em>)
Hello?
<strong>Charlie</strong>: <em>Eddie?</em>
Charlie? You okay?
I think I did a bad thing.
(<em>Retching</em>)
(<em>Laughs</em>): Athena, come on. You-you followed him?
Not my finest hour, but I needed to know where he was going.
Okay, and?
He went to a meeting.
<em>Now, that's a great thing. Right?</em>
Except he lied to me about it.
<em>So you still think that he's hiding something.</em>
(<em>Sighs</em>)
Maybe not a what.
Maybe a who.
(<em>Speaks indistinctly</em>)
Got to go. Talk later.
(<em>Siren wailing</em>)
(<em>Tires screeching</em>)
Buckley, you get promoted to captain when I wasn't looking?
Only vehicle available.
Diaz, you called this in?
Yeah. Possible O.D.
She's over here. I-I don't think she's breathing.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: We're here now, we got her.
<strong>Mehta</strong>: Do we know what she took?
<strong>Buck</strong>: Yeah, uh, Eddie thinks it's tetrahydrozoline poisoning.
Uh, eye drops.
She always puts drops in my food.
She thinks I don't see her, but I do.
I just wanted to see what would happen if I gave them to her.
I-I'm sorry.
Oh, no, that's okay, that's okay.
You didn't mean to hurt her.
<strong>Buck</strong>: Yeah, the kid's gonna need treatment, too.
Same kind of poisoning, just smaller doses.
But for a really long time.
<strong>Maddie</strong>: <em>So she was hurting her own kid?</em>
<strong>Chimney (<em>over phone</em>)</strong>: <em>Yeah, for money or attention or something that doesn't really even matter.</em>
My God. That's terrible.
You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad she fell through that balcony floor.
At least that kid will be safe, far away from her.
Yeah. Sounds like he's better off without her.
<em>Yeah, I guess some people just aren't meant to be parents. Anyway, kind of made me want to hear your voice,</em> tell you guys how much I love you.
<em>You're sweet.</em>
How are things there? I don't hear Jee-Yun crying.
<em>That seems like a good sign.</em>
She's finally asleep.
<em>Well, that's a relief. Hey, listen, Hen just showed up, and I want to hear about her mom. Can I call you later?</em>
Yeah.
Yeah, we're good here. There's nothing to worry about.
You followed me to a meeting?
You lied to me.
I couldn't understand why, and then I saw her.
That's Rachel Hawkerson, the drunk driver from the pileup.
Are you sponsoring her?
Look, I am trying to help her.
She's having a hard time finding somebody to talk to who can actually relate to what she went through.
The other night, when you came home smelling like bourbon?
That was Rachel's.
She fell off the wagon and called me, she was still drinking when I got there, and the bottle spilled on me when I tried to take it away from her.
You gonna have to help me out here, Bobby.
Why didn't you just tell me what was going on?
Because it's not my story to tell.
I didn't want to violate her confidentiality.
Oh, you can tell me what you're doing without telling me who.
All the sneaking around, leaving me in the dark.
Why shut me out? I'm your wife.
Yeah. It's hard when your spouse keeps things from you.
Trust me, I know.
Wait.
Is this supposed to be some kind of punishment?
You mean you're keeping this secret on purpose to get back at me?
No!
I don't know.
I decided to help somebody and I didn't think I needed to tell you about it.
You don't let me in on half the decisions you make.
Like what?
You decided to go back to work without talking to me about it, just like you stopped seeing Dr. Sanford without mentioning it to me, and then it turns out you were offered retirement and you dismiss it, and I'm kept completely in the dark about it.
I didn't think I needed to ask you for your permission.
You don't. This is about me not even being a factor or a consideration.
You don't... It doesn't cross your mind to include me in the conversation or wonder what I might think.
We're supposed to be partners, but the truth is, you don't want one, at work or in your life.
I'm used to doing things on my own. That's who I am, and you knew that when you married me.
Well, I thought that, eventually, you would start to trust me more, but now I'm starting to think that you're just gonna always keep this wall up and I'm always gonna feel like an outsider looking in.
Well, maybe you wouldn't feel like an outsider if you talked to me instead of playing this tit-for-tat game.
Marriage isn't supposed to work like that.
Well, who said this marriage is working?
We're not partners because that's how you want it.
(<em>Indistinct radio chatter</em>)
What about my mom?
Will I see her at the hospital?
<strong>Eddie</strong>: She's a little more sick.
She's got to go to a different hospital.
This is your ride.
<strong>Sheila</strong>: My-my baby!
Where's my baby?
(<em>Muffled</em>): Where's my baby...
(<em>Engine starts</em>)
Should've gotten here sooner.
That kid is just lucky he met you.
<strong>Mehta</strong>: Diaz, you want to ride with the kid to the hospital?
Yeah. That'd be gr...
(<em>Gunshot</em>)
(<em>People screaming</em>)
<strong>Mehta</strong>: Get down!
(<em>Radio crackles</em>)
Shots fired. Shots fired. A firefighter is down. I repeat, firefighter is down! Shots fired. Shots fired.
