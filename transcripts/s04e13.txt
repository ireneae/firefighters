All you got to do is hang on.
Push through the pain.
"911," all-new Mondays.
And watch other Fox shows like "Lone Star," "Prodigal Son," and "The Resident" on Fox.
I swear, I already told you everything I know.
Let's begin by getting a baseline.
Is your name Nora Perez?
You know it is.
Damn it! Yes or no?
Yes.
Is today Saturday?
Yes.
Then tell me, was it you who divulged my secret information?
For the thousandth time, no.
Not now, Mom.
Sorry to interrupt, sweetie, but makeup's ready for Nora.
But I haven't found the snitch yet.
It's okay, honey.
I know you've been trying your best, and that's all that matters.

To ridicule me.
They are calling me a bridezilla.
You sent us to a nutritionist.
I was concerned about your health.
You told her to make sure none of us were thinner than you today.
You sound like you're holding a grudge.
Are you the one that's going online and trashing me? Sweetheart, the wedding's in two hours.
Maybe it's time we got you in your dress.
Fine. I will kill two birds with one stone, and find a rat in the process.

Chim, how's our bride doing?
Just a second.
What-what happened?
You experienced an electrical shock and passed out.
Is this a polygraph machine?
Um, yeah.
Is it, is it still working?
Maybe if you're looking to grill something.
I thought you were getting ready for a wedding.
Is this some kind of reality show?
Got a nasty exit wound on the sole of her foot from the electricity.
She probably absorbed at least 1,800 watts.
Bethany's just a little nervous about her big day, wanting everything to be just right.
She thinks one of us is a saboteur, mocking her online, anonymously.
One of you is. And I am gonna find out who "Trapped_By Bridezilla_ One-hundred-percent" is before I walk down the aisle. The only place you should be walking is into an ER.
There's no telling what that current did to you internally.
So we're gonna need to take you to the hospital for an ECG.
Unacceptable.
Ma'am, no. No, ma'am...
Because I...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ma'am, please take it easy.
I'm getting married in less than two hours.
How's my makeup?
Uh, well, I think they can probably fix that.
Right.
Right, 'cause we can just paint a new eyebrow on, right?
Yeah, I-I mean, I-I saw this makeup thing online, and this woman made her face look like a skull.
It was cool.
We'll just do a photo shoot after our honeymoon.
Yeah. Today, you have the veil.
Right. So the only thing left to address is the snitch. Sweetie.
Can't we just let it go and celebrate the happiest day of our lives?
My life. My day.
And I'm not going down the aisle when there is a traitor in my midst.
It was me.
I'm Trapped_By Bridezilla_ One-hundred-percent.
I'm Trapped_By Bridezilla_ One-hundred-percent.
Um, I-I'm Trapped_By Bridezill_- One-hundred-percent.
Damn it! We're not doing <i>Spartacus!</i> I actually am Trapped_By Bridezilla_ One-hundred-percent, because have I been in hell this last year with you.
Betrayer!
I always suspected we were too lenient with you, Bethany, that we spoiled you too much, but dear God, you're a monster.
That's it!
You are officially excommunicated from the wedding.
But I'm paying for it!
Well, the check's already cleared.
So I want you gone.
All of you! Get out!
All I need are new eyebrows and my dress.
Yeah, about that...
Sorry.
Good luck with the wedding.
A seven-year-old boy presents with persistent cough, low-grade fever and runny nose.
His parents tell you that he hasn't had immunization since he was about four years old, and that he vomits after prolonged coughing spells.
What is your diagnosis?
Well, first I'd listen to his lungs.
And depending on that, I would need his BP...
<i>Eh.</i> Time's up.
Pertussis, better known as whooping cough.
Treatment is macrolide antibiotics for bacterial infection.
Don't "eh" me. I was getting there, eventually.
Hi, Mrs. Wilson.
Hi. Hey, Ma.
You going out?
Picking up some groceries.
Karen called, told me about that farmers market over by the park.
Did she say how it's going over at her brother's?
Is Denny having a good time?
Karen said they're running around like a pack of wild animals after a yearlong hibernation.
Maybe I'll bring you guys back a treat.
Cookies always did the trick when you were studying as a kid.
They still do for me.
Gotcha.
Ah!
Oh!
Ma. You okay?
Damn back acting up again.
Ma, you look like you're sweating.
Do you got a fever?
Oh, honey, just because you're studying to be a doctor doesn't mean I'm interested in being a patient.
I will pop a couple of ibuprofen, it'll pass.
You sure?
Good luck with your studying.
Okay. What's the next question?
Popcorn bucket.
Screen.
Movie. Movie theater, movie theater.
Oh, come on.
Ding, ding, a movie theater.
How did you get "movie theater" from that?
You two must have some kind of sibling shorthand.
No, it's called cheating.
Okay? Uh -- Listen, you know, where's Bobby? I need my partner.
I'm not sure where he is. He should have been home by now.
Just said he was having lunch with someone from work.
And I thought I was your partner.
Oh, baby, I-I just usually play with Bobby, that's all.
Oh, it's for your own safety, trust me.
Bobby is the only one who can deal with Michael's competitive streak.
You'll thank me later.
Oh, there he is. Hey.
Hey.
Bobby!
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. Lunch went long.
Bobby!
Oh, that's okay. We were just doing a couple of practice rounds till you got here.
You ready to kick some butt, partner?
I am, I just got to get these clothes off -- I've been racing around -- take a shower, and then I'll join you guys.
A shower?
Yeah, it'll just be a minute.
Wheatgrass is Mother Nature's green elixir.
It can cure just about anything.
Even helps people lose weight.
I believe it.
I'm pretty sure I'd lose my appetite after a shot of this.
Everything you see here is vegan, non-GMO, free from wheat, gluten, dairy, egg and soy.
So what's it made out of? Air?
Finally. Food I recognize.
And a smell I wish I didn't.
Don't be scared off by the smell; the taste is incredible.
Savory, sweet and creamy all at once.
It's a culinary adventure.
I think I'm looking more for a culinary walk around the block.
You know, maybe some grapes, a couple of oranges.
We have Jaffa oranges, Cara Cara navel, blood orange.
Were you looking for anything in particular?
Are you okay?
Ma'am? Ma'am, are you okay?
Someone call 911!
Ma.
Are you okay?
Hi, baby. I'm okay.
Just a little banged up.
What happened? Your mother experienced a freak syncopal episode, possibly vasovagal.
A what?
You got dizzy because your heart rate and blood pressure suddenly dropped.
Did she mention she was also experiencing back pains earlier?
Her chart shows back surgery following a car accident in 2004.
I thought she might have been running a fever earlier.
Henrietta, I'm fine.
Mom, you're in the emergency room.
Clearly you're not fine.
Uh, her temperature was normal upon admittance.
I mean, this could also be dehydration, or maybe an allergy to something at the farmers market.
Or sometimes people just faint.
That's...That's it? You...
"People just faint"?
Did you do an-an echo?
An echo isn't indicated.
She should talk to her primary care physician about adjusting her blood pressure medication.
Maybe think about making some adjustments to her diet.
Could help to lose weight.
And, uh, maybe stay off WebMD.
Your mother's fine.
He was useless.
A complete waste of a doctor's coat.
Which is why I never go.
Uh...Yeah.
What do you think? That's better, right?
I think it looks exactly the same?
I just want everything to be perfect.
It's been over a year.
It's gonna be awesome.
Coming!
Okay.
Carla!
Hey!
Hey...
Hey!
Hey.
Oh, I missed my boys.
Oh...
Oh, I missed you.
I missed you.
Yeah?
Oh.
I'm sure your teacher was thrilled.
Oh, no, no, let me get those.
Oh, please.
You prepared a lovely meal. I can help Eddie clean up.
You can't go in the kitchen.
Oh. Oh, that's right.
Mm-hmm.
We have some business to take care of.
We do, don't we?
Okay.
It is so good to have you back. We missed you.
I'm sorry about your father.
Me, too.
I'm just grateful I was able to spend that time with him.
Mm.
Still...
I know I left you in the lurch, and I'm sorry for that.
Oh, no, no, no.
You were where you were supposed to be.
I'm glad you had that time, too.
Mm.
Christopher seems good.
I know you were worried about him.
Yeah, he's doing a lot better.
Mm.
Almost back to his old happy self.
And he loves having Ana around.
What about Dad?
How does he feel about the young Ms. Flores?
It's nice.
It's, uh...
easy being with her.
Ana is lovely.
And I'm glad that you're finally moving on.
But just be sure that you're following your heart, not Christopher's, okay?
Surprise!
Happy birthday, Carla.
But my birthday's in March.
And we missed it twice.
You got me two cakes.
Light the candles, Dad.
Okay, this is a disturbing number of candles.
Thank goodness there's a firefighter in the house.
Thank you, honey.
You okay?
That's the third cup you've had in the last hour.
Not that I'm counting. More of a guestimate.
I didn't know it was humanly possible to feel this tired.
So Jee's still not sleeping through the night?
No, that would mean she would have to stop crying long enough to actually sleep.
The doctor says that it's colic, but I don't know.
It's...it's the way she cries.
No matter what I try, nothing calms her.
Well, what about you?
Are you doing anything to soothe yourself?
I'm just doing my job.
911. What's your emergency?
<i>My mom, she fell, and now she's stuck.</i> <i>Can you send help to get her out?</i> What's your location? <i>-We're at home.</i> <i>The Regal Pointe Apartments.</i> Okay, help is on the way. What's your name?
Charlie. <i>-Charlie, can you tell me if your mom is hurt?</i> Help!
I don't know. I'm not supposed to go out there. I'm sick.
<i>It's okay. You did the right thing by calling.</i> <i>Where exactly is she stuck?</i> The balcony.
She fell through the floor.
It's like it swallowed her up.
Help!
Help!
All right, Buck, get up there. I'll be right behind you.
Okay.
BOBBY Ma'am, this is the LAFD.
We're on our way up to you now.
Just, uh, hang on tight.
Oh, uh, hi-hi there.
Sir, can-can we use your balcony for a few minutes?
It's, uh, to help her.
Sheila?
Hi, Clarence.
Come on in.
I'm gonna cook inside.
All right. LAFD, ma'am.
We'll get you out of there.
Okay, Eddie, it's your turn. Head on up.
Hey.
How you doing?
I know I put on a few quarantine pounds, but I didn't think it was this bad.
Well, from the looks of you, I don't think you have anything to worry about.
But you are stuck in there pretty good.
I'm gonna put this rescue strap around you, secure you to that ladder, so if the rest of this balcony goes, you stay up here with me. Sound good?
Sounds great.
But also a thing I didn't know to be afraid of until right now.
No need to be afraid. I got you.
Okay.
All right, guys, keep sending up the ladder.
It's okay, sweetie.
Don't worry.
Your son?
Yeah.
Who would've guessed the worst part about being a single mom is having nobody to pull you out of the balcony after you've crashed through it?
The wood looks completely rotted.
Probably water damage or termites.
It's a good thing he wasn't out here.
Figures. This place is practically falling down around us.
I can't afford to do repairs, and my landlord never fixes anything.
Maybe a visit from the fire department might change his attitude.
How we looking down there, guys?
Okay, we shored up the balcony as best we could.
We got a platform underneath in case she falls.
You're not gonna fall.
I just have to leave for a minute.
I got to go let our paramedics in the door.
Okay.
You must be Charlie the hero.
I didn't do anything.
You did exactly what you're supposed to, you called 911.
That was quick thinking of you. You really helped out your mom.
Vitals are good. BP's 120/80.
Copy that. She definitely cut her leg, Cap.
I saw some blood dripping.
We can't access her till we pull it out.
Okay, let's pry away those rotted wooden slats, make a bigger opening, then we lift her up and out.
Buck, Eddie, get yourself on safety lines before you head out there, in case this whole thing goes.
Okay, should be enough of a gap around to pull her out now.
Sheila, put your arms around my neck and hold on.
I'll pull you up.
I got you.
All right, let's get her on the board.
It hurts. Looks pretty bad.
The wood really tore her leg up.
She's gonna need stitches.
I can't go to the hospital.
Ma'am, a doctor needs to clean this and sew it up so it can heal properly, not to mention a tetanus shot.
No, but Charlie.
Oh, he can ride with you to the hospital.
We've got plenty of room.
He has an autoimmune disease, and the hospital is the worst place for a sick child.
All those germs.
And I don't really have anyone to stay with him.
I'll stay. I have a kid around Charlie's age.
We'll get along fine.
No, that's -- I can't ask you to do that.
You didn't ask. I offered.
No, no, I can't leave him. Please.
Hey, Charlie.
Want to help me out with the ropes, kid?
<i>Bourbon.</i> <i>His shirt reeked of it.</i> Yeah, but Bobby hasn't had a drink in years, has he?
Not that I know.
But he's been acting strange, distant.
Put that together with a bourbon-soaked shirt, and I don't know what to think.
Except maybe he's drinking again.
Well, have you talked to him, Athena?
Oh, not yet.
I'm not even sure what to say.
Every question sounds like an accusation.
I can see that you're worried, but I got to say none of this sounds like the Bobby I know.
The problem is, there's a Bobby I never met.
The one who lost everything because he lost control.
Yeah, but he isn't that man anymore.
He thinks he could be.
A few months back, the drunk driver who caused the pileup on the 710 -- Bobby told me there was only one difference one bad day.
What if he's had that one bad day?
Hmm.
<i>You're lucky.</i> My mom's a terrible cook, but your dad's great.
<i>Did he order take-out?</i> <i>I was thinking the same thing.</i> Hey, watch it, I'm right here.
Oh, shoot.
No worries.
I got it.
Uh, where does your mom keep the paper towels?
Upper cabinet.
<i>Charlie, what school do you go to?</i> I don't go to school.
Because I'm sick. We move around a lot.
I'm not supposed to go out, except for doctors' appointments.
<i>What kind of doctors?</i> I don't know, all kinds.
We're always going to see a new one.
Whew. Sounds expensive.
What's your mom do for work?
She always says her job is to take care of me.
We're lucky because we get donations from a Fund Me page.
Ah.
I'm home.
Hey.
Look who's back.
And all patched up.
Hi, Mom.
You cooked for him.
Charlie has a very sensitive stomach.
Figured you'd be a little wobbly when you got back.
Just wanted to make it easier for you.
Don't worry, Mom, I don't feel sick or anything.
That's great, sweetheart.
Oh, this is my new friend Christopher.
<i>Hi, Charlie's mom.</i> <i>Bye, Charlie's mom.</i> <i>-Bye, Charlie. Bye, Dad.</i> Bye, guys.
He's super cool.
Do you think we could hang out sometime?
We'll have to see.
No, Mom, I'm not nagging you, I'm-I'm just checking on you.
Okay, great.
Well, maybe you should...
And she hung up on me.
Take it as a positive sign.
Must mean she's feeling better.
So how are you doing?
Fine.
I'm still a little freaked out not knowing what's wrong with my mom.
Well, maybe you should take her to see a specialist.
I would, but I need to have some idea of what's wrong first.
And that doctor was no help.
He practically dismissed us.
Eh, you know how crazy it can get in the ER.
Not that I'm not defending him, I'm just saying.
He barely acknowledged we were in the room, Chim.
And when I asked questions, he acted as if I offended him.
Like, "How dare you?" I mean, I hate to think it, but maybe our experience would have been different if he had looked more like us.
I was a 12-year-old Korean boy translating to the doctor on behalf of my sick mother.
Makes you wonder how bad it is for a patient who doesn't have anyone, no one to advocate for them.
That's why people like you and me can't put all our trust in doctors.
Because they don't trust us.
To know how we're feeling, to-to know when something's wrong.
I know something's wrong, Chim.
What you need are some brilliant medical minds to bounce ideas off of.
You know any of those?
I'm pretty sure you do.
This is what we call the index of suspicion, where we assess how seriously a condition should be considered as a diagnosis.
Henrietta.
Mom, please. Just humor me.
Okay.
Do your worst.
62-year-old female presents with dizziness and intermittent back pain.
Patient has a history of high blood pressure and smoking.
I haven't had a cigarette since before Henrietta was born.
Still goes in the history.
BP's normal, heart rate's a little elevated, but that could be stress.
Okay, so why would she be stressed?
Maybe because you keep referring to me as "she." What about kidney failure? Could explain the back pain.
It would've shown up in the blood labs from the hospital.
One of the few tests they did take.
Could be an inner ear problem, like, uh, Ménière's disease.
Would explain the loss of balance and dizziness.
Ma, can you hear me?
Of course I can hear you.
Okay, here's a crazy thought. Huntington's disease?
I hadn't considered that. Mrs. Wilson, are you experiencing any other loss of motor function?
I did my nails this morning.
I think they look pretty good.
Has she been around ticks?
We haven't thought about Lyme disease, have we?
Lupus? Multiple sclerosis?
Iron deficiency? Anemia?
Cross that off the list.
No, her limbs aren't stiff. Scratch that.
Take that off the list. Nah, we checked that.
I think we've exhausted our options.
I told you I was fine.
But I do appreciate your diligence.
M-Mom?
Ma.
She's burning up.
Her heart is racing.
Picking up a pulsating sensation around her navel.
It's definitely cardiac.
Her abdominal aorta?
A triple A?
An abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Ma, we got to get you to the hospital.
Wai -- You think it ruptured? I mean, if it did, she...
She's gonna die.
I'm home!
Maddie?
Oh. Good, you're back.
Oh, come here, sweet baby.
How was your day?
Fine, except for the nonstop crying.
That's okay.
♪ <i>Strong men also cry.</i> ♪ Don't they, Jee-Yun?
Are you okay? Something else going on?
It's the way she cries, like she's in pain.
All the time, and I just don't know how to help her.
Oh, it's just the colic.
I wish there was more we could do to soothe her, but...
Ugh, God, why is everyone so damn focused on being soothed right now?
I'm sorry.
To both of you.
There you go.
That's better, huh?
You're really good with her.
So are you. You've been doing great.
You know what? I have not had a minute to myself all day.
So, you good with her while I hop in the shower?
No place I'd rather be.
Right? Huh, baby Jee?
Miss Daddy?
Yeah, he missed you, too. Okay.
Just need to borrow this.
Okay, all right. Just right here. Ma, get in.
Uh, can I help you? Go. I got this.
Yes, you can. I was actually thinking of having surgery at this hospital, but I kind of want to vet it first.
Vet the hospital?
Uh, yes, and I have a few questions.
Uh, so this might take a few minutes.
Why don't you write this down?
Can I help you? I have a patient.
Female, 62 years old.
She's experiencing dizziness, back pain, and orthostatic hypotension.
Could be looking at abdominal aortic aneurysm.
We need an electrocardiogram to verify, stat.
Uh...Hello?
You heard her.
Uh, of course.
I'll get someone right away.
Echo and EKG show severe deterioration of the abdominal aorta.
Imaging shows that a rupture was imminent.
They're prepping her for surgery now.
So, she's okay?
They should be able to graft the artery, yeah.
The surgical team will be by in a few minutes, go over the procedure with you, answer any questions you may have.
Hopefully more thoroughly than you were the other day.
I beg your pardon?
She could have died if I hadn't brought her back in.
You sent us home with-with no explanation, no diagnosis and barely any treatment.
Look, I am sorry that I missed it.
But the important thing is that we caught it in time...and your mother is gonna be fine.
"We"?
You know, when I'm out in the field on a call, I have a split second to diagnose a patient, if I'm lucky.
I-I can't run blood, do an X-ray or-or order an echo.
All I have is what I know, and my ability to listen to what the patient is saying.
Even with every tool a-at your disposal, you still got it wrong.
Okay, what-what would you have had me do differently?
Believe them when they tell you that something is wrong.
Start there.
Oh.
Carla.
Uh, here you go.
Does he like video games?
I have some old ones I don't play anymore.
You know what, I'm not sure. I didn't see a television when I was there.
You know, let's just stick to books and toys.
No TV?
He really does need our help.
Just remember that help doesn't always come in the form of screen time.
Uh-huh.
Wow, someone's feeling generous.
Hey, Eddie.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.
Now, don't let him give away the whole house while I'm gone.
CARLA Okay.
What's going on?
I was thinking about what you said, how that family supports themselves through their Fund Me page, so I started looking around...
You went snooping?
I was trying to make a donation.
Maybe circulate it on the faculty newsletter.
But I think there's something wrong with this woman.
That feels like a leap.
You haven't even met her.
No, but I found some weird stuff online.
I think she lied to you.
About what?
<i>That's a lot of Fund Me pages.</i> There's Sheila and Charlie Burns in El Paso, Sheila and Charlie Young in Phoenix, and Sheila and Charlie Watts of Santa Fe.
It's him, the same kid every time, just with different last names and different cities.
Charlie did say they moved around a lot.
That would explain the different accounts and different cities, but not the different names.
What did his mom say his illness was?
She didn't. Not really.
Said it was autoimmune.
Well, that's awfully general.
Charlie did say he goes to a lot of different doctors.
Could be doctor shopping.
Which is what you do when you're not really sick, you're just looking for a doctor to say that you are.
You think she's lying?
Well, we wouldn't be the only ones.
Most of the Fund Me pages were shut down, but the comments are still up.
"This woman is a fraud and a scammer.
Do not trust her." "She's a con artist looking for money and attention." Oh, God. What?
"I think she's making her kid sick." Oh, you didn't have to do dishes.
You cooked.
Well, that's okay.
What do you say, you want to watch a movie?
May is out and Harry's at Michael's.
We could have a date night in.
Um, rain check?
I just had a really long day, I think I got to crash.
Hmm. Is everything okay?
I mean, if something's bothering you, if something's on your mind, you know you can talk to me.
Everything is fine.
Nothing to talk about.
It doesn't feel fine.
I'm worried about you.
Athena, I'm...
I know you have your meetings, and I'm glad you have people that you can talk to.
But you can talk to me, too.
Yeah, I know, it's -- the meetings...not the same.
Yeah, I know.
I can never really understand that part of your life, but I'd like to try.
Maybe I can go with you to your meeting?
You have one tomorrow, right?
That is very sweet of you, but no.
I-I don't have one tomorrow, but you could come on Saturday.
Great.
Good, okay. Good night.
I'm fine, Karen. You, you stay there.
I'll call you when I have an update.
You're still here?
You didn't, you didn't have to.
It's your mom.
Thank you.
For everything.
Hen.
Ms. Wilson?
Good news.
Hey, Ma. How you feeling?
A little sore...but a lot grateful.
The surgeon did a good job.
You're gonna make a full recovery, Ma.
I'm glad to hear that.
But it's not the doctor I'm grateful for.
You saved my life.
Well, the truth is, I got used to having you around.
So I'm not ready to let you go just yet.
I won't be around forever, Henrietta.
Ma...
I won't.
So let me say this.
I am so proud of you.
Henrietta, you...working so hard and going to school, taking care of your family.
I know it's a struggle.
But it is worth it.
Because people like me?
We need doctors like you.
So, promise me...no matter how hard it gets, you won't give up.
You promise?
I promise.
Guess B shift's still out on a call.
Damn.
You're early. Couldn't sleep.
You remember the mom the other day? Sheila?
With the sick kid? Yeah.
He's not sick. Not really.
She's making him sick. Probably for years.
Munchausen by proxy? That's a big accusation, Eddie.
I tracked down some people that knew them before.
All signs point to it.
The nonspecific autoimmune disease, the revolving door of doctors.
He's frail, he's weak, he's always throwing up.
She's poisoning him.
Poisoning him? W-With what?
Eye drops. I saw them in the kitchen.
Eye drops. Tetrahydrozoline could cause the symptoms that you're talking about.
It can be lethal if it's ingested, doesn't show up on a standard toxicology test.
You have to know to look for it to find it.
She's dosing him.
Not enough to kill him but enough to keep him sick.
I called social services.
They're coming here to take a report.
Why-why would she do that?
Well, sometimes it's to gain sympathy.
Oh, or maybe to make a profit.
I found multiple Fund Me pages.
She's conning people out of their money.
Hello? <i>Eddie?</i> Charlie? You okay?
I think I did a bad thing.
Athena, come on. You-you followed him?
Not my finest hour, but I needed to know where he was going.
Okay, and?
He went to a meeting.
<i>Now, that's a great thing. Right?</i> Except he lied to me about it.
<i>So you still think that he's hiding something.</i> Maybe not a what.
Maybe a who.
Got to go. Talk later.
Buckley, you get promoted to captain when I wasn't looking?
Only vehicle available.
Diaz, you called this in?
Yeah. Possible O. D.
She's over here. I-I don't think she's breathing.
We're here now, we got her.
Do we know what she took?
Yeah, uh, Eddie thinks it's tetrahydrozoline poisoning.
Uh, eye drops.
She always puts drops in my food.
She thinks I don't see her, but I do.
I just wanted to see what would happen if I gave them to her.
I-I'm sorry.
Oh, no, that's okay, that's okay.
You didn't mean to hurt her.
Yeah, the kid's gonna need treatment, too.
Same kind of poisoning, just smaller doses.
But for a really long time.
<i>-o she was hurting her own kid?
S</i> <i>CHIMNEY Yeah, for money or attention</i> <i>or something hat doesn't really even matter. t</i> My God. That's terrible.
You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad she fell through that balcony floor.
At least that kid will be safe, far away from her.
Yeah. Sounds like he's better off without her.
<i>Yeah, I guess some people ust aren't meant to be parents. j</i> <i>Anyway, kind of made me want to hear your voice,</i> tell you guys how much I love you.
<i>You're sweet.</i> How are things there? I don't hear Jee-Yun crying.
<i>That seems like a good sign.</i> She's finally asleep.
<i>Well, that's a relief.
ey, listen, Hen just showed up, H</i> <i>and I want to hear about her mom.</i> <i>Can I call you later?</i> Yeah.
Yeah, we're good here. There's nothing to worry about.
You followed me to a meeting?
You lied to me.
I couldn't understand why, and then I saw her.
That's Rachel Hawkerson, the drunk driver from the pileup.
Are you sponsoring her?
Look, I am trying to help her.
She's having a hard time finding somebody to talk to who can actually relate to what she went through.
The other night, when you came home smelling like bourbon?
That was Rachel's.
She fell off the wagon and called me, she was still drinking when I got there, and the bottle spilled on me when I tried to take it away from her.
You gonna have to help me out here, Bobby.
Why didn't you just tell me what was going on?
Because it's not my story to tell.
I didn't want to violate her confidentiality.
Oh, you can tell me what you're doing without telling me who.
All the sneaking around, leaving me in the dark.
Why shut me out? I'm your wife.
Yeah. It's hard when your spouse keeps things from you.
Trust me, I know.
Wait.
Is this supposed to be some kind of punishment?
You mean you're keeping this secret on purpose to get back at me?
No!
I don't know.
I decided to help somebody and I didn't think I needed to tell you about it.
You don't let me in on half the decisions you make.
Like what?
You decided to go back to work without talking to me about it, just like you stopped seeing Dr. Sanford without mentioning it to me, and then it turns out you were offered retirement and you dismiss it, and I'm kept completely in the dark about it.
I didn't think I needed to ask you for your permission.
You don't. This is about me not even being a factor or a consideration.
You don't -- It doesn't cross your mind to include me in the conversation or wonder what I might think.
We're supposed to be partners, but the truth is, you don't want one, at work or in your life.
I'm used to doing things on my own. That's who I am, and you knew that when you married me.
Well, I thought that, eventually, you would start to trust me more, but now I'm starting to think that you're just gonna always keep this wall up and I'm always gonna feel like an outsider looking in.
Well, maybe you wouldn't feel like an outsider if you talked to me instead of playing this tit-for-tat game.
Marriage isn't supposed to work like that.
Well, who said this marriage is working?
We're not partners because that's how you want it.
What about my mom?
Will I see her at the hospital? She's a little more sick.
She's got to go to a different hospital.
This is your ride.
My-my baby!
Where's my baby?
Where's my baby...
Should've gotten here sooner.
That kid is just lucky he met you.
Diaz, you want to ride with the kid to the hospital?
Yeah. That'd be gr...
Get down!
Shots fired.
Shots fired. A firefighter is down.
I repeat, firefighter is down!
Shots fired. Shots fired.
