<strong>Newsman</strong>: <em>A powerful storm hit land in Haiti yesterday morning, causing massive destruction in a nation still recovering from August's devastating earthquake. Residents are now grappling with catastrophic...</em>
Man, why anyone would want to live in the path of constant hurricanes will never cease to amaze me.
Right.
They should move here, where nothing bad ever happens.
Oh.
Fair point.
I'm going there.
You're going where?
To Haiti?
(<em>chuckles softly</em>)
Yes.
I want to help with relief efforts.
Since when?
Since people I know reached out and asked me to.
It's not the first time.
I've always had a reason to resist, but...
I think I ran out of those reasons.
Okay, okay, my head is spinning right now.
When?
Soon.
I have to talk to the hospital first.
I still have a few surgeries on my calendar.
For how long?
A month or two.
Maybe longer.
So are you leaving me?
It's only for a while. If you want to be mad at someone, blame my boyfriend.
He introduced me to a world of folks who never hesitate to rush into an emergency.
I think some of that rubbed off.
You know I'm really in love with you, right?
I had my suspicions.

<strong>May</strong>: Oh.

Don't mess up. Don't mess up.
Mm-mm.

Oh, you're nervous.
(<em>Athena chuckles</em>)
Oh.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Uh...
<strong>Harry</strong>: Be careful.
Whoa, whoa. Don't be... Be careful.
Oh, you're nervous. I see you shaking.
Be careful.
Oh! (<em>gasps</em>)

What? You want to play like that, huh?
Oh, my God.

Hey, uh, you guys, I have some news.
David is going to Haiti.
Haiti? Why?
Well, he knows some people there that are doing relief work.
They need doctors. He wants to help.
And he's leaving next week.
Well, how do you feel about that?
I'm proud of him.
You know, sad for me.
But before he goes, uh...
I'm gonna propose.
Michael.
No, Athena, it's not what you think.
What, that you want to put a ring on it because David's leaving and you're scared?
No, it's just...
I've been thinking about being without him for the next few months, and I realized that I don't want to be without him ever.
You know, I want to be with him for the rest of my life.
And I don't want him to leave without knowing that.
<strong>May</strong>: Well, that's sweet.
I'm happy for you, Dad.
Oh. Thank you, honey.
(<em>chuckles softly</em>)
<strong>Harry</strong>: So, now I'm gonna have three dads.
Uh, eh, something like that. (<em>chuckles</em>)
Father's Day is gonna suck.
(<em>laughter</em>)
<strong>Michael</strong>: This guy.
But...
I like David, so... you can marry him.
You know, I felt like he was already part of the family.
Right? (<em>chuckles</em>)
So, what, you want my blessing?
Uh, you know, it would be nice.
But I am going to propose either way.
(<em>chuckling</em>)
You know, Bobby and the kids already said yes, so you're outvoted.
Well, you know, you're lucky that I'm happy for you.
<strong>May</strong>: Mm.
So, congratulations.
Thank you.
So how are you going to propose?
(<em>&quot;Shining Star&quot; by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire playing</em>)
<strong>May</strong>: Mm-hmm.
Well, um...
<strong>Harry</strong>: He doesn't know.

Ambulatory patients go to parking lot A.
Triage patients go to parking lot B.
Ambulance transfers go to lot C.
And please, stop calling 911.
Explosion was on the fourth floor, Charlie side.
The sprinkler system lost pressure in the concussion, so evac is already in process.
Anybody who can walk has already vacated.
The rest are gonna need our help, starting with the nursery.
Cap, there's 600 beds in there.

<em>Where's the command center, out here in front?</em>
Yes, the tents in the parking lot.

Hey.
Please. Please. Hey, listen.
He's a surgeon. His name is Dr. David Hale.
People are still being evacuated.
You wait for him out here, you let us do our job.
Okay.
Copy. I'll let him know.
Dr. Hale?
What do we know?
It was an explosion in the maternity ward.
Fire has not been contained.
They're advising we close immediately.
We're almost done here.
Maternity ward is on the east end of the hospital.
Let's continue on until someone tells us otherwise.
Let's hope they get that fire under control.

Hey, you're okay, you're okay.
Good?

<em>Can you see it?</em>
Yes.

You're doing fantastic, honey.
Should we leave? Where should we go?
<em>No, no, no, no.</em>
You stay right where you are. I'm sending help to you.
<em>Just keep close to the ground for me, okay, honey? You and the baby stay away from the door.</em>
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Hey, I need you on the third floor.
We got an eight-year-old boy, Parker.
He's trapped up there with his baby sister.
I thought that floor was cleared.
Well, they must've missed him in all the chaos.
He dialed 911 from a patient's room, 318.
Back up the ladder.
No, fire was right outside the nursery.
Stairs.
Dispatch, my guys are on the way.

Hard to tell.
But there's a guy helping dig people out of the rubble.

You need to go now and let us do our job.
It's not safe in here. Sir!
It's Rupert.
Okay, Rupert, we appreciate your help, but you must leave.
I'm not leaving without Callie.
Listen to me, it's too dangerous in here, okay?
I'm not asking you! I am telling you.
I survived stage-four cancer.
I can survive this.
Ravi.
I'll get him.
Sir, please wait.
(<em>Phone ringing</em>)
Yes.
Dr. Hale, the fire has breached the fire door and is entering the oncology ward.
All nonessentials evacuate now.
I'm staying with this patient.

Start bagging.

<strong>Athena</strong>: Excuse me. Excuse me.
(<em>coughs</em>)
There he is.
(<em>grunts</em>)
Oh! (<em>chuckles</em>)
(<em>chuckles</em>)
(<em>exhales</em>)
I got him.
(<em>crying</em>)
You. It's you.
Yes.
(<em>whispers</em>): Yes.
Yes?
Yes.
Oh, my God.
(<em>indistinct chatter</em>)
Over there.
(<em>siren wailing</em>)
<strong>Hen</strong>: Callie?
How are you feeling?
Where's Rupert?
He didn't make it.
And I'm not so sure we would have, either, without him.
I found this on him.
(<em>crying</em>): I can't read it.
Would you?
Sure.
(<em>paper rustles</em>)
&quot;Dear Callie...
All my life, I've been one of the unlucky ones.&quot;
<strong>Rupert</strong>: <em>Glass half full because that's simply all life had to offer me. So when I got cancer, I thought, &quot;Of course.&quot; Just another small pour from life to me as we clinked our glasses for one final goodbye.</em>
(<em>Sofia crying</em>)
<em>But when you came into that chemo room with a smile on your face, you changed my perspective. Taught me that I could pour myself a tall glass and stay a little while longer if I fought like hell. And we did. I beat it. We beat it. Together. I am eternally grateful for you and your faith in me the last three years. I pray to God I will not see you inside this hospital again, but I sure do hope to see you on the other side. Take care, my dear. And thank you. Rupert.</em>
I get why he did what he did.
Rupert?
I spent practically my entire childhood in hospitals.
Those doctors and nurses become your family.
I didn't know that.
It's not exactly fun party talk.
It was chemo on the weekends instead of soccer tournaments.
But those people cheered me on just the same.
They saved my life.
So I get why he ran back into the building.
To pay it forward.
I guess that's why you do it, too.
How are you doing?
I'm fine.
Better.
Thanks for earlier.
Not sure I really did anything.
My number one rule: no crying at work.
(<em>sighs</em>)
Least I didn't do it on the floor.
Sorry you had to see that.
Don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't see anything.
(<em>siren wailing</em>)
(<em>horn honks</em>)
Oh, let's see the bling.
Ooh!
<strong>Athena</strong>: Nice.
<strong>May</strong>: It's amazing.
<strong>Michael</strong>: All right, everybody.
As it turns out, I have one more announcement to make.
Go for it, Dad.
Okay, as you know, David is going to use his incredible gifts to help those in need in Haiti.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: All right.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Mm, aw.
Yeah, that's so wonderful.
<strong>Michael</strong>: And, uh, I've decided to go with him.
You know, I-I can't save lives, but I can help rebuild one.
Dad.
Now, Harry has already given me his approval, and I hope that you would, too.
That's amazing.
I'm really proud of you.
<strong>Michael</strong>: Oh.
I learned from watching you.
All of you, really.
You know, with, uh, my brain tumor and then the pandemic and-and then my job, you know, at times, I-I really felt a...
(<em>exhales</em>) Felt a little lost.
But last night, I watched people come together and save someone that they didn't even know.
More than one.
And I said to myself, &quot;I can do that, too.&quot;
(<em>&quot;That's How Strong My Love Is&quot; by Otis Redding playing</em>)
That's wonderful, Michael.
I mean, not in an actual fire, because that's terrifying, you know, and you people are crazy.
