<i>A powerful storm hitN and in Haiti yesterday morning,l</i> <i>causing massive destruction in a nation still recovering</i> <i>from August's devastating earthquake.</i> <i>-Residents are now grappling with catastrophic...</i> Man, why anyone would want to live in the path of constant hurricanes will never cease to amaze me.
Right.
They should move here, where nothing bad ever happens.
Oh.
Fair point.
I'm going there.
You're going where?
To Haiti?
 Yes.
I want to help with relief efforts.
Since when?
Since people I know reached out and asked me to.
It's not the first time.
I've always had a reason to resist, but...
I think I ran out of those reasons.
Okay, okay, my head is spinning right now.
 When?
 Soon.
I have to talk to the hospital first.
I still have a few surgeries on my calendar.
For how long?
A month or two.
Maybe longer.
So are you leaving me?
It's only for a while. If you want to be mad at someone, blame my boyfriend.
He introduced me to a world of folks who never hesitate to rush into an emergency.
I think some of that rubbed off.
You know I'm really in love with you, right?
I had my suspicions.
Oh.
 Don't mess up. Don't mess up.
 Mm-mm.
 Oh, you're nervous.
 Oh.
Uh... Oh, no. Ooh. Be careful.
Whoa, whoa. Don't be-- Be careful.
 Oh, you're nervous. I see you shaking.
 Be careful.
 Oh!
 Dude!
 What? You want to play like that, huh?
 Oh, my God.
Mm-hmm.
All right, make room for some food.
Oh, my...
Double cheese and onion?
Harry special, right there.
Michael, quit loitering!
Come eat!
Uh...
Uh...
Hey, uh, you guys, I have some news.
David is going to Haiti.
Haiti? Why?
Well, he knows some people there that are doing relief work.
They need doctors. He wants to help.
And he's leaving next week.
Well, how do you feel about that?
I'm proud of him.
You know, sad for me.
But before he goes, uh...
I'm gonna propose.
Michael.
No, Athena, it's not what you think.
What, that you want to put a ring on it because David's leaving and you're scared?
No, it's just...
I've been thinking about being without him for the next few months, and I realized that I don't want to be without him ever.
You know, I want to be with him for the rest of my life.
And I don't want him to leave without knowing that.
Well, that's sweet.
I'm happy for you, Dad.
 Oh. Thank you, honey.
So, now I'm gonna have three dads.
Uh, eh, something like that.
 Father's Day is gonna suck.
This guy.
 But...
I like David, so...
you can marry him.
You know, I felt like he was already part of the family.
Right?
 So, what, you want my blessing?
 Uh, you know, it would be nice.
But I am going to propose either way.
 You know, Bobby and the kids already said yes, so you're outvoted.
Well, you know, you're lucky that I'm happy for you.
Mm.
 So, congratulations.
Thank you.
So how are you going to propose?
Mm-hmm.
 Well, um...
He doesn't know.
I have never been more unsure about something in my life.

Yeah, he's fine, he's fine. So, so sorry about that.
 It's my fault. I-I didn't see it. You're fine, young man.
Just keep your eyes on the road next time, all right?
Thank you. Come on, let's go see your mom, yeah?

Explosion was on the fourth floor, Charlie side.
The sprinkler system lost pressure in the concussion, so evac is already in process.
Anybody who can walk has already vacated.
The rest are gonna need our help, starting with the nursery.
Cap, there's 600 beds in there.
What are we gonna go do with them?
 911. What's your emergency?
 911. What's your emergency?

All right.
L. A. County Medical Alert Center has provided us a list of surrounding hospitals and available beds. Let's keep updating capacity.

 Yeah.
 Sir, there is a fire.
No one can go into the hospital.
<i>But my sister's in there!-</i>  All patients are being evacuated.
<i>-Evacuated to where?</i>  Command center will have updates about your sister.
<i>Where's the command center, out here in front?</i> Yes, the tents in the parking lot.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, my ears are still ringing from the explosion, but I'm fine. How do I get inside?
You don't. You leave that to us.
But-but my boyfriend is in there.
We need a paramedic over here!
 Hey.
Please. Please. Hey, listen.
He's a surgeon. His name is Dr. David Hale.
People are still being evacuated.
You wait for him out here, you let us do our job.
Okay.
Copy. I'll let him know.
 Dr. Hale?
 What do we know?
It was an explosion in the maternity ward.
Fire has not been contained.
They're advising we close immediately.
We're almost done here.
Maternity ward is on the east end of the hospital.
Let's continue on until someone tells us otherwise.
Let's hope they get that fire under control.
Hey, you're okay, you're okay.
 Good?
 Yeah.
All right, here comes the first one.
It's okay, it's okay.
Here we go.
Let's go down there.
I know, I know.
How's it looking up there, Buck?
Uh, smoke is starting to breach the door, Cap.
Okay, let's double-time it, guys.
We move quickly and carefully.
Hen, how are they all doing?
All healthy so far, Cap.
Running oxygen for possible smoke inhalation.
<i>COMMANDER Any available paramedics,</i> <i>report to the fourth floor</i> <i>east corridor for evacuation assistance.</i> Copy that. 118 has two coming your way.
Hen, I want you on the floor four, eastern side.
Ravi, go with her.
Help, help, help!
Sir, these paramedics are gonna help you.
My kids. Where's my baby?
Okay, all the babies have been evacuated from the nursery, sir.
No, no.
Our daughter wasn't in the nursery.
She was with my son, Parker.
He's eight years old.
Sofia.
Shh, it's okay.
It's okay.
Hello? Hello?
Help! Anybody here?
 What's your name, sweetie? <i>-Parker.</i> And where are you right now, Parker?
<i>In the hospital.</i> My mom just had a baby.
<i>- Parker, are you with the baby right now?</i> Yes. I-I lost my parents.
<i>There was an explosion! We're alone!</i> <i>I woke up on the floor.</i> Parker, I want you to stay very low to the ground, okay?
<i>an you describe where you are?
 C</i> <i>Do you see a room number?</i> It should be right outside the door.
<i>-Can you see it?</i>  Yes.
I see one. It's 318.
Room 318. Great, Parker.
You're doing fantastic, honey.
 Should we leave? Where should we go? <i>-No, no, no, no.</i> You stay right where you are. I'm sending help to you.
<i>Just keep close to the ground for me, okay, honey?</i> <i>You and the baby stay away from the door.</i> Hey, I need you on the third floor.
We got an eight-year-old boy, Parker.
He's trapped up there with his baby sister.
I thought that floor was cleared.
Well, they must've missed him in all the chaos.
He dialed 911 from a patient's room, 318.
Back up the ladder.
No, fire was right outside the nursery.
Stairs.
Dispatch, my guys are on the way.
<i>Copy, 118.</i>  How many more up there?
 Hard to tell.
But there's a guy helping dig people out of the rubble.
 One of ours?
 No, one of ours.
 A nurse?
 A patient.
LAFD! Anybody up here?
There's one more up there-- he won't leave.
 LAFD. Sir!
LAFD. Sir, we got to get you out of here.
I'm fine. Help me move this.
Oh, my God.
 No pulse.
 It's not Callie.
 Sir, the hospital's been evacuated.
 No, no.
There's-there's still someone here who needs help.
 Callie!
 Hold up. No, no, sir?
You need to go now and let us do our job.
It's not safe in here. Sir!
 It's Rupert.
 Okay, Rupert, we appreciate your help, but you must leave.
I'm not leaving without Callie.
Listen to me, it's too dangerous in here, okay?
I'm not asking you! I am telling you.
I survived stage-four cancer.
I can survive this.
 Ravi.
 I'll get him.
 Sir, please wait. <i></i> Yes.
Dr. Hale, the fire has breached the fire door and is entering the oncology ward.
All nonessentials evacuate now.
I'm staying with this patient.
Then so are we.
All right.
I want all oxygen and anesthesia to this room shut off immediately.
Start bagging.
<i>Parker, honey, you doing okay?-</i>  You <i></i> <i>Parker?</i> I put the towels under the door, but the smoke's still coming in.
Is there water in the room?
<i>A bottle or-or a pitcher?</i>  Yeah, a pitcher. <i>-Great.</i> Pour it on the towel you placed under the door, okay?
<i>And soak it really well, okay, baby?</i> <i>Let me know when you're done.</i> Done.
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Come on, come on.
Unit 118, this is Dispatcher Collins.
We've lost connection with a minor caller <i>in room 318.</i> <i>Line is dead.</i> Copy that, Dispatch. We're almost there.
This is us.
Damn, it's bad up here.
Heading that way, but this floor is fully involved.
I told him to take shelter in the room, shut the door and seal it with a towel. Room 318.
We can't go any further without a hose line.
Guess these will have to do.
Aah, too hot! The flames are too high!
Firefighter Buckley, Firefighter Diaz, are you there?
Do you copy?
<i>Firefighter Diaz, do you copy?</i> Did you make it to room 318?
There is no 318.
It's gone.
Fire took it.
Copy.
I think you need to take five.
 I'm fine.
 No, just take it anyway.
911. What's your emergency?
Michael!
Athena!
How did you...?
May called me.
 Are you all right?
 Yeah, I'm fine!
It's David-- he's the one still inside the burning building.
LAFD is calling for a mandatory evac-- we've got about five minutes before they come in here and drag us out themselves.
That won't be necessary. Almost done.
Margins are clear.
He's hemorrhaging.
 Blood pressure's dropping.
 Everything's dropping.
I have to stop the bleeding.
Approaching stroke territory.
Okay, you all need to leave now. I mean it. Go now.
With all due respect, Doctor, we leave when you leave.
What do we say? Faith in science.
And each other.
Hen, over here! Come on!
 Is she alive?
 Callie? Callie?
Thank God.
Ravi, get a tourniquet on that leg.
Callie, your pulse is strong.
Did anything hit y-your neck or-or your head?
 Don't think so.
 Okay.
Give me some fingers and toes.
Okay, good, good, good. That's very good.
I'm gonna get this collar on your neck, bandage your wound and get you the hell out of here, okay?
So glad we found you, Callie.
When that explosion went off-- Can't believe you're here.
You're not a patient anymore.
Yeah, well, I got used to this place.
I'm not leaving just yet.
Get her out of here.
 Get out!
Rupert?
You okay?
This kid, he was eight years old.
And his sister?
I know.
What are we supposed to do with that?
We put it away and we save the next one.
Parker.
<i>They said they were coming to get me and my sister.</i> Parker, I need you to stay with me on the phone, okay?
Firefighter Diaz, this is Dispatcher Bates.
<i>-Do you copy?</i>  Go ahead, Dispatch.
 Did you get into room 318? <i>-Negative.</i> 318 was lost to the fire.
Well, the little boy just called me back.
Uh, hold on, he-he's alive?
 Where is he? <i>-He's still saying 318.</i> <i>Is it possible you were at the wrong room?</i> No, but I think he was.
 Is there an 81  E in the hospital?
Yes. On the fifth floor.
He was reading, he was reading a reflection!
Let's go!
<i>They're on five.</i> <i>nce you get past the elevators,  O</i> <i>they're the third room on the left.</i> Copy that. Almost there!
74! 76!
 75!
 Let's go! Keep going, keep going!
This is 82!
Hey, there we go-- that's 318 backwards.
 LAFD! Anyone in there?
Fire department!
Baby's alive.
His pulse is stable, but he's out.
Must've been the smoke.
 There you go. It's okay.
I got you.
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!
<i>Dispatch, this is Firefighter Diaz.</i> <i>Got both kids alive.</i> <i>Evacuating now. Let's go, let's go!</i> Thank you.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Not now.
You don't need to be in here.
Well, I just thought you might like to know the kids are okay.
The little boy Parker and his baby sister.
They found them.
 What?
 The little boy.
He gave you the wrong room number.
What-what do you...?
How is that possible?
He called back.
He saw the numbers in a reflection in the hall.
You figured that out?
A firefighter did when I radioed him.
So I guess you could say this was a group effort.
 You were part of that, too.
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
Take all the time you need.
 Okay.
 I'll be here.
Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, thank...
I need as much help over here as possible.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Make your way over here! Let's go!
Athena.
Anything?
No.
Nothing.
Bobby!
Um, excuse me.
Where's David?
Have you seen him? I-I think he's in one of the ORs.
Well, he should've been evacuated by now.
What's he still doing in there?
He was in the middle of surgery  when the explosion happened.
 He didn't come out.
I think he's still in there.
You got to find him, Bobby.
I will see what I can do.
He can't die on me.
He is not gonna die.
He's lost 250 cc's and counting.
Let's have blood on standby.
 On it.
 There's the aneurysm.
It's already ruptured.
I need a clip to stop the bleeding.
Generator failure. We are on battery backup.
Start a timer. We've got 20 minutes.
Internal bleeding, compact fracture.
She lost a lot of blood, but her vitals are good.
What about him?
Broken neck. No signs of life.
Hey.
You okay?
I was supposed to save him.
Not the other way around.
You did everything you could, Ravi.
I don't see how you do this.
I have faith in Bobby.
And so should you.
 David.
 I can't now, Bobby.
We need to evacuate now.
If I walk out of this room, this man dies, and I can't let that happen.
I promised his wife.
And I promised your husband.
Michael's not my husband.
Well, he wants to be.
He's standing outside this hospital right now with a ring in his pocket-- or maybe a watch, I'm not sure-- waiting to propose.
 I have to finish.
 I'll give you ten minutes.
I need 12.
I will do my best.
All available units, respond to OR Five for defend in place.
<i>I repeat, all available units,</i> <i>respond to OR Five for defend in place.</i> Cap needs us. Let's go! Come on!

He didn't make it.
And I'm not so sure we would have, either, without him.
I found this on him.
I can't read it.
Would you?
Sure.
"Dear Callie...
All my life, I've been one of the unlucky ones." <i>Glass half full because</i> <i>that's simply all life had to offer me.</i> <i>So when I got cancer, I thought, "Of course."</i> <i>Just another small pour from life to me</i> <i>as we clinked our glasses for one final goodbye.</i> <i>But when you came into that chemo room</i> <i>with a smile on your face,</i> <i>you changed my perspective.</i> <i>Taught me that I could pour myself a tall glass</i> <i>and stay a little while longer if I fought like hell.</i> <i>And we did.</i> <i>I beat it.</i> <i>We beat it.</i> <i>Together.</i> <i>am eternally grateful for youI</i> <i>and your faith in me the last three years.</i> <i>pray to God I will not see youI nside this hospital again,i</i> <i>but I sure do hope to see you</i> <i>on the other side.

Rupert?
I spent practically my entire childhood in hospitals.
Those doctors and nurses become your family.
I didn't know that.
It's not exactly fun party talk.
It was chemo on the weekends instead of soccer tournaments.
But those people cheered me on just the same.
They saved my life.
So I get why he ran back into the building.
To pay it forward.
I guess that's why you do it, too.
How are you doing?
I'm fine.
Better.
Thanks for earlier.
Not sure I really did anything.
no crying at work.
Least I didn't do it on the floor.
Sorry you had to see that.
Don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't see anything.
 Oh, let's see the bling.
 Ooh!
Nice. It's amazing.
All right, everybody.
As it turns out, I have one more announcement to make.
Go for it, Dad.
Okay, as you know, David is going to use his incredible gifts to help those in need in Haiti.
