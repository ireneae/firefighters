( <em>Beeping</em> )
<strong>Hen</strong>: <em>4.5 billion years ago, an astral body the size of Mars slammed into the Earth.
The debris that flew from our planet became stuck in Earth's gravity and formed our moon. That's right.
The moon is just a part of the Earth, separated forever, always drawn back towards us, longing to reconnect.
It is said to increase fertility, create chaos and cause people to do things they would never normally do.
No one knows why things get so weird when the moon is full, why it makes people act so crazy.
All I know is that on this job, the one night you need to be ready for anything is a night when the moon is full.</em>
You, uh, want to watch a <em>Ray Donovan?</em>
( <em>Sighs</em> ) I wish, but...
( <em>Sniffles</em> ) ...I have to get my sleep tonight.
It's gonna be a full moon tomorrow and it's always crazy.
I need to make sure that I am rested.
( <em>Sighs</em> )
Well, maybe we could have some close time.
It'll help you sleep.
( <em>Chuckles</em> ) It'll take a whole lot longer than an episode of <em>Ray Donovan</em> to finish.
Not for me.
( <em>Chuckles</em> )
I don't mind doing the extra work to get you across the finish line.
Shade, shade, shade, shade, shade.
I love you, baby.
Mm-hmm.
You are the most beautiful, sexy, powerful woman I've ever seen, but tonight I got to get my sleep, babe.
( <em>Sighs</em> )
( <em>Clears throat</em> )
LBD.
Karen, don't say that.
I'm just tired.
Lesbian Bed Death.
Doesn't matter how hot a couple is for each other.
Eventually, we all succumb to it.
Come on. I get what I need.
Like, don't you feel the magic when we're cuddling?
I've just been in relationships that have been more like sisterhoods before.
If we're not having sеx, then what exactly is it that makes us a couple?
Okay.
Just let me get my rest tonight...
Uh-huh.
And when I come home after work tomorrow, we'll crawl into bed.
It'll still be a full moon.
And who knows what kind of crazy stuff might happen?
Oh.
Tomorrow. Okay.

♪ I see trouble on the way... ♪
All right, folks, coming through.
Excuse me, please.
Hi.
Hi.
( <em>Gasps</em> ) What you doing there?
I'm gonna have to take you out if that's okay with you.
All right. You'll be fine.

♪ There's a bad moon on the rise... ♪
Hi. Are you ready?
Yeah? Watch your head.
Oh, I got you.
I got you.
Thank you.
I can't believe they didn't have a key for this.
Don't worry. It's, uh, it's one of those nights.
And here. Congratulations on your moo-moo.
Here we go.
( <em>Cell phone ringing</em> )
911, what's your emergency?
( <em>Buck howls</em> )
You're such a dork.
You're a cute dork, but you're a dork.
<strong>Buck ( <em>over phone</em> )</strong>: A cute dork.
Okay. I'll take that.
<strong>Abby</strong>: How are you? How you feeling?
How's your first day back?
I feel great.
Uh, no pain, got minor discomfort, but, uh, don't you worry.
I have someone monitoring my bread intake.
I'm so relieved.
So, when are we gonna do this again?
I mean dinner, not the tracheotomy.
I don't know.
Um, I have a run of shifts, but I will check the schedule.
Are you buckling in?
Uh, am I buckling in?
Oh, full moon.
It's gonna get bumpy.
Uh, no. I do not buy into all that full moon BS.
Whoa, &quot;buy into&quot;? No, no, no.
It-it is science. You know?
Every full moon, the freaks come out.
Crime increases, emergency rooms are packed, animals and kids go nuts.
No, in my experience, anyone who's gonna be an idiot on the full moon is gonna be an idiot on the half moon or the quarter moon or the no moon.
( <em>Phone ringing</em> )
There is no statistical evidence that any crime or accidents... or general freakiness increase during the full moon.
Abby, I just pulled a kid out of one of those stuffed animal arcade games.
I know, but that would've happened whether it was a full moon or not.
Mm, you don't know that.
I do know that.
How many full moons have you worked?
Um, one.
Right. Bye, Buck.
( <em>Laughing</em> ): No, wait, hold on.
Hold on. Look, I'm telling you.
All right? Freaks come out.
Now you call me when the night's over, okay?
( <em>Buck howls</em> )
Bye, Buck. Bye.
What's he doing, ma'am? Is he trying to get in?
No. No, he's just standing there.
He's looking at me.
I can't see his eyes, but I can feel them.
Why is he here?
It's okay, ma'am.
What does he want?
Can you tell me your name and address, please?
Nora Curtis. 3942 Rosewood.
<strong>Abby</strong>: I'm dispatching police to your location, Nora.
Can you describe the man for me?
I can't see his face.
He doesn't have a face.
Why doesn't he have a face?
Nora...
I can't, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe. I can't...
It's so tight. I can't breathe.
It's okay. All right, help is on the way, Nora.
( <em>Wheezing</em> )
Just stay on the line with me.
They called you for a prowler?
Homeowner has a heart condition.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Well, you two traveling a little light.
Yeah, a full moon.
Only way to survive is divide and conquer.
Hmm, I believe it's your enemy you're supposed to divide, not yourself.
All right, I'm-a check around back.
Okay.
Is that what that means?
Paramedics.
The paramedics are here.
Thank you, Abby.
You're welcome, Mrs. Curtis.
Nora.
You're welcome, Nora.
While I was waiting for you, he just seemed to disappear.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Blood pressure's dropping.
Was I having a heart attack?
No, no, no.
Looks more like a panic attack.
He gave me such a fright... standing out there... just staring.
You're okay now. All right?
Now, ma'am, I want you to breathe for me, nice and slow, not too deep, and when you exhale, I want you to purse your lips like this. ( <em>Exhales</em> )
Okay?
Okay.
You're safe now.
Full moon. Brings out the creeps and the crazies.
Breathe, okay?
Breathe.
( <em>Exhales</em> )
Ma'am, is this where you were standing when you saw the man outside?
Yes.
Ma'am, I'm Sergeant Grant.
If there was someone outside, they're gone now.
Thank you.
'Thena.
Hmm?
<strong>Athena ( <em>quietly</em> )</strong>: Yeah?
It look to you like anybody had been outside?
No. I mean, the ground's wet. Didn't see any footprints.
I did.
She says that she was standing pretty much right over here.
He was in the house.
Standing right behind her.
Okay. I just got the chills.
He didn't attack her, though.
Maybe that wasn't his intent or maybe when she called 911 it spooked him, but it looks like he came in the front door.
Ma'am, uh, you mind if I take a look around the inside?
Oh, no. Go ahead.
Is there somewhere else you can stay tonight?
Someone you can call?
Why?
You think he's coming back?
You've been through a lot tonight.
It might be best if you had some company, that's all.
I could call my daughter.
That's a great idea.
All clear here. Pulse is good.
<strong>Dispatcher</strong>: P/R, unconscious male.
MacArthur Park. Subject appears to be unresponsive.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Copy. Paramedic 118 responding.
That's a dicey neighborhood.
I'll give you a police escort.
Thanks.
Ma'am, I have an officer out front.
He'll stay there until your daughter picks you up.
That's wonderful. Thank you.
Remember to breathe.
I will. Thank you.
Absolutely. You just rest, okay?
You're good now.
Thank you both.
You want to tell me what that was all about?
I'll tell you in the truck.
What's your name?
Kathy.
( <em>Glass shatters</em> )
Kathy, where are you now?
I... I... I locked the front door and I'm upstairs in the bedroom.
Is there anyone else with you?
No, nobody.
( <em>Loud thud</em> )
He-He's in the house.
He-he broke through the door.
Okay, Kathy.
( <em>Panting</em> )
Kathy, are you still there?
( <em>Panting</em> ) Uh-huh.
Okay. Stay on the phone. Lock the bedroom door if you can.
( <em>Thudding</em> )
He's at the door. He's at the door.
He's here, he's here!
Okay, okay, Kathy, tell him you've called 911 and the police are on their way.
Can you do that?
I-I-I'm on...
I'm on with 911.
( <em>Thudding</em> )
The police are coming.
Kathy.
Why are you here?
Why are you here? Why?
Why? Why? Why?! Why?!
( <em>Screaming</em> )
( <em>Thudding, squishing</em> )
( <em>Dial tone buzzing</em> )
Oh, my God.
It's a fact. Gravity is heavier during full moons, scientists have proven it.
You read this in a peer-reviewed, scientific publication?
Uh, I don't know, is the Internet considered a &quot;scientific publication&quot;?
Buck, the idea that the moon causes odd behavior and happenings goes back to the first century.
It's folklore, magical thinking.
( <em>Coyote howling</em> )
( <em>Elevator bell dings</em> )
Hey. She's this way.
Jackie's six months pregnant. She's new.
This class is only open to moms who are at least 26 weeks.
I warn them about overexerting themselves.
And behold, the Salabhasana.
( <em>Jackie gasping sharply</em> )
Yeah, Locust Pose.
I've dated, like, 50 yoga instructors.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Can you guys please clear out so we can get in there.
Ladies, back to your mats.
Thank you, thank you.
I'll take it.
<strong>Jackie</strong>: I can't move.
Everything hurts.
The baby, is he okay?
Okay, we're gonna check your baby right now.
Okay? I'm gonna touch you right here on your stomach.
Ooh.
Okay. There's no trauma to the abdomen.
Vitals seem normal.
Fetal heartbeat's normal.
Okay, good.
( <em>Grunts</em> ) Is the baby okay?
Your baby is fine.
Oh, he's not mine.
I'm a surrogate.
Listen, can you tell me where you're feeling your pain?
Is it localized in your back, your arms, your legs?
( <em>Grunting</em> ): Arms and legs, but it's-it's the worst in my butt and down my thigh and calf.
Okay, I think you slipped a disc.
We're gonna need to get her on her side, okay?
Very carefully support her head.
All right, got it, Bobby.
Let's go this way towards you guys, okay? Very gently.
<strong>Woman</strong>: ( <em>Screams</em> ) Oh...
Okay...
All right, I'm gonna take care of that.
You take care of this.
I got it. Go, go, go.
<strong>Buck</strong>: Here we go. I got you, I got you.
I think I'm having contractions.
How far along are you?
38 weeks.
38 weeks. Okay.
All right, just keep breathing with your contractions.
Nice and easy, all right? What's your name?
Beth.
Okay, I need a cup of water for Beth.
Am I in labor?
I think it's Braxton Hicks, it's a soft labor.
What does that mean?
That means your contractions are gonna go away once we get you nice and relaxed and hydrated, okay?
Okay. Mm-hmm.
Just take a drink.
( <em>Whimpers</em> ) Oh, my God. My water broke.
♪ Baby, baby, baby ♪
Buck?
Yeah, I'm on it.
Uh, Dispatch, requesting additional paramedics to 232 Hope, possible spinal disc herniation.
Need transport to hospital immediately.
It's coming. It's coming now.
Yeah, you only just started contractions, it's okay.
No, this is my fourth kid. It's coming.
Uh, okay, I need towels! I need towels!
( <em>Screams</em> )
Please, she's almost there.
Okay, these contractions are a minute apart.
This isn't soft labor, is it?
No. You're having your baby.
Oh, my God, can I go to the hospital?
With contractions this close together, I can't bring you to the hospital.
Transporting you's too risky right now.
But you're in good hands.
I've delivered babies before.
Okay.
( <em>Woman screams</em> )
Oh, no, no, not now.
Seriously? I'm not... Bob, I've never done this before.
It's okay. I will talk you through it.
They say when a full moon's halfway between the eastern horizon and its highest point, it can induce labor.
( <em>All groaning</em> )
I knew I should have canceled this class.
Just saying, I did tell you.
Okay, we can discuss the moon later, Buck.
If you're not in labor right now, could you please go out in the hallway and give us some space. Thank you.
I have two, possibly three women in labor.
Membranes have ruptured.
Labor is progressing rapidly.
I need a couple of extra transports to the hospital.
Okay, Beth, I need you to push, okay?
( <em>Screams</em> ) I want my epidural!

Okay.
Buck, you ready?
Yeah.

Okay, I got it.
Okay. And cut.

Uh, just-just keep on breathing. Um...
Oh, my God, just go. I got this.
You're gonna deliver your own baby?
Yes, I told you, it's my fourth.
And she's a doula.
Okay, uh, okay.
( <em>Woman screams</em> )
Okay, okay. What are you feeling?
Something's wrong.
I didn't feel like this with my last baby.
How tall are you?
Four foot 11.
Did your doctor ever tell you anything about the size of the baby? Is it big or...?
Yeah, he's big.
He's big. Okay.
I saw the ultrasound. His head is huge.
( <em>Sirens approaching</em> )
Okay, I think you're experiencing something called CPD, cephalopelvic disproportion.
That means your baby's head is too big for your pelvis.
Okay? But you're gonna be okay.
( <em>Elevator bell dings</em> )
We're gonna get you an emergency C-section.
You're gonna be fine.
Guys, come on in.
Oh, God.
Right here.
Is my baby gonna be okay?
We need to call my husband.
The baby's gonna be fine and so are you.
Slow, slow, slow.
We'll call your husband on the way.
There's no rush.
Hey, don't push. There you go.

♪ Got me down in misery ♪
It's a boy.
Yes.
Well, I'm Buck, and that's Bobby, just in case you want to name him after us.
You know, in our honor or something.
No, I don't think so.
( <em>Chuckles</em> )
You still think this full moon stuff is a myth?
Yes, and I still think you're an idiot.
St. Matthews, contact OB surgical on call, we've got an emergency C-section coming in, four minutes out.
How you holding up?
Um, hmm, just pissed... that I can't seem to shake this.
Just keep hearing her screaming.
It's okay if you want to go home.
I can cover you.
Not gonna leave you in a lurch.
On the full moon, which I don't even really believe in.
There's a detective here.
He wants to hear the call, Abby.
What kind of detective?
Homicide.
<strong>Sue</strong>: <em>This is Abby Clark.</em>
She took the call.
Detective Marks.
Nice to meet you.
You wanted to hear the tape.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Uh, I've read the fast transcript, but, uh, reading isn't the same as hearing.
No. It isn't. Come this way.
<strong>Kathy</strong>: <em>Why are you here?! Why are you here?!</em>
Why?! Why?! ( <em>Screaming</em> )
( <em>Call ends</em> )
Well, thank you, Ms. Clark.
Welcome.
What were you hoping to hear?
Well, things sometimes get missed in the transcripts.
I was hoping...
You might hear his voice?
Hard to hear anything under these screams, even if he had said something.
Maybe I could dig it out if it's there.
I mean, if that would help you guys find him.
Oh, we've already caught him.
Oh.
Yeah, the ex-husband.
She'd been granted multiple protective orders against him.
And he had been charged with domestic battery on more than one occasion.
She was afraid of him.
Has he confessed?
No. They, uh, they generally don't.
Now, if I had his voice on that tape, it'd make things a little bit easier, but, um, at least he's off the streets.
He's not going anywhere for now.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you.
Good luck with it.
Thank you.

Hey, Terry.
Would you do me a favor?
Would you check the system for any 911 calls made from that number or address in the last... three years?
Sure.
Thanks.
911. What's your emergency?
<strong>Kathy</strong>: Yes, my name is Kathy Blake.
I'm at 837 Harper, and my ex-husband is outside my front door.
<strong>Trent</strong>: Open the door!
His name is Trent McConnell and he's not supposed to be within 50 yards of this house.
<strong>Trent</strong>: Open the door, you b¡tch. I want my stuff.
<strong>Kathy</strong>: Trent, you psycho, I'm on the phone with the cops.
Keep doing what you're doing if you want to spend the night in jail again.
Ma'am, I've dispatched officers to your location.
<strong>Kathy</strong>: I swear to God, I am holding a butcher knife, and if you come through that door before the police get here, I will use it.
( <em>Pounding on door</em> )
He's at the door. He's at the door!
He's here, he's here!
( <em>Wood cracks</em> )
Trent, you psycho, I'm on the phone with the cops.
Keep doing what you're doing if you want to spend the night in jail again.
Why are you here?! Why are you here?!
Why?!
( <em>Screaming</em> )
( <em>Thudding, squishing</em> )
It's not the husband.
They got the wrong guy.
So, basically, it's a twist on &quot;the call came from inside the house.&quot;
Only it was a reflection and there was no call, so it's nothing like that at all.
I don't know, a full moon... maybe it was a spirit.
Spirits don't leave muddy footprints.
You don't know that. What if it was raining in purga...
Chimney, stop talking.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Copy that.
( <em>Woman screams</em> )
Go. I got this.
<strong>Woman</strong>: Get off him! Stop!
Help! Somebody help!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Slowly turn around and show me your hands!
My God, what the...?
What the hell is this kid on?
Probably bath salts.
It's a crazy mix of chemicals that causes violent, psychotic behavior.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Step away from the man.
Are you hearing me?!
( <em>Distorted</em> ): Turn around slowly.
Did you see a weapon? I don't see anything.
I'm not sure, I don't... No, I don't think so.
<strong>Athena</strong>: I'm not gonna ask you again!
( <em>Electricity crackling</em> )
( <em>Growls</em> )
( <em>Barks</em> )
Athena, you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm good.
You sure?
Yeah. Go. Make sure that guy's okay.
( <em>Sighs</em> ) Detectives want statements from both of us.
You want me to go first?
It's all you, Chim.
Do I refer to the guy as the perp or the face eater?
( <em>Chuckles</em> )
( <em>Ambulance pulls away</em> )
( <em>Phone vibrates</em> )
This is Hen.
<strong>Eva ( <em>over phone</em> )</strong>: Well, it better be.
I called her cell phone.
Who is this?
Palmar Women's Correctional Facility.
To accept the charges, please press one.
Eva?
( <em>Laughs</em> )
Yeah, I'm out, baby.
No thanks to you.
Eva, listen, about that...
Relax, I'm just messing with you.
I put you in an awkward position, I know.
I apologize.
Okay, well, thanks for understanding.
How long have you been out?
A week.
I wanted to make sure I had my footing before I called you, so I got a job at a small tax firm.
You know, it's just an entry-level thing, but if I work hard, I can climb my way up.
That's great.
Um, listen, you-you kind of caught me at a bad...
Come over.
What?
Come on.
Come celebrate. I want to show you my new place.
It's not much, but, uh, it's got a bed.
( <em>Chuckles softly</em> )
You're awful.
I know.
So come over and let me apologize for being so awful.
Maybe I can, uh, put you in another awkward position.
( <em>Laughs</em> )
Uh... um, listen, I'm-I'm glad you're home, and that, you know, you're-you're doing well.
Um, I am.
But, uh, I got to go.
( <em>Exhales</em> ) Everything all right?
Yeah, well, it is for now.
I mean, so far, no one's questioning whether or not it was justified.
Hell, I wasn't gonna let that monster eat my face.
( <em>Chuckles</em> )
You know, it's gonna be a long night.
Back to the station, talk to OIS and the DA, and then, back here, walk them through it.
Probably have to ride the desk for a couple of days till the DA is satisfied there's nothing here.
Hmm. I got your back if they come calling.
You always do.
That wasn't your wife on the phone, was it?
Mm, no, it wasn't.
Everything all right at home?
It's fine.
&quot;Fine,&quot; huh?
Mm-hmm.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Mm.
Hen.
Now, you know I love you.
All right? Glass house, all that jazz.
But my advice, you let it go long enough, ain't no coming back from &quot;fine.&quot;
Everything was fine in my marriage until the bomb went off.
Athena, I appreciate your concern, but we're good.
Karen's not a bomb waiting to go off.
I wasn't talking about her.
( <em>Beeping</em> )
<strong>Kathy ( <em>on recording</em> )</strong>: Trent, you Psycho I'm on the phone with the cops. Just keep doing what you're doing if you want to spend the night in jail again.
Well?
Right. This just confirms it.
He had been harassing her for years.
Oh, yeah, but don't you hear the difference between the two calls?
I mean, when she was with her ex-husband, she was upset, but she was pushing back.
You know, she was fighting him.
And she called him by his name.
Tonight, she didn't mention a name, and it was completely different.
It was like... blind terror.
Because she finally realized what he was capable of.
It's dark, her focus is split 'cause she's talking to you.
She may not have realized it was her ex until it was too late.
You know, a woman with a history like that, I mean, if a guy's trying to break in, she's gonna presuppose that it's her ex.
That's not the guy who came in tonight.
Look, it's clear you care about what you do.
I imagine you're not used to losing one.
I got to believe, hearing someone die like that?
Not an easy thing to just shake off.
Well, I take over 200 emergency calls in a ten-hour shift.
I don't just shake them off, I move on.
'Cause there's always another call to move on to.
And I listen to every single one.
( <em>Sighs</em> )
And I know what I'm hearing here.
Here's what I know.
All right? 99% of the time, the guy you think did it did it.
It's my job to find the evidence to prove it.
And my job is to listen, and hear what people tell me, and hear what they don't tell me, and hear everything that goes on around them.
I'm telling you, the person who killed that woman tonight is still out there.
It wasn't her ex-husband.
You can go ahead and include this and any other calls from the victim in what you're sending to us.
We'll consider everything.
Okay.
Well, at least he didn't pat me on the head.
It's with the police, now.
Well, you may not have convinced him, but you convinced me.
I think there's something else you should hear.
<strong>Kathy ( <em>on recording</em> )</strong>: Yes. My name is Kathy Blake.
I'm at 837 Harper, and my ex-husband is outside my front door.
You hear that?
What?
Here, let me dig it out.
Yes. My name is Kathy Blake.
I'm at 837 Harper, and my ex-husband is outside my front door.
<strong>Woman</strong>: Tell them about the restraining order.
There's somebody else there?
<strong>Kathy</strong>: outside my front door.
<strong>Woman</strong>: Tell them about the restraining order.
A woman.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't know what it gets you, exactly.
It gets us eyes in the room.
I mean, somebody who can tell us if Trent McConnell would even be capable of this.
Because the only other person in the room is dead.
So FID and the DA's office will run their investigations and present it to the board.
Until they make their final determination, you're riding a desk.
Yeah, I know the protocol.
Listen, Sergeant, no one wants to jam you up here.
But it hasn't been that long since you got <em>off</em> restricted desk duty.
So just don't give them a reason.
If they come back to you with more questions...
( <em>Phone vibrating</em> )
.. you call me first.
( <em>Sighs</em> )
It was a good shoot, Athena.
I got your back, okay?
Yeah. Thanks, Jerry.
All right.
Yeah. Athena Grant.
<strong>Abby ( <em>over phone</em> )</strong>: Sergeant.
It's Abby Clark calling.
Abby.
So how's your night?
Oh, you know... ( <em>Laughs</em> ) a little unsettling tonight.
More unsettling than performing an emergency tracheotomy on a first date?
( <em>Chuckles</em> )
You heard about that?
Yeah, girl.
All right, what can I do for you tonight?
<strong>Abby</strong>: I'm trying to track down a police report.
I need to find a witness on an old domestic call.
You got a date, address?
Yeah.
October 29, 2015.
837 Harper.
Call came in just before midnight.
So what's got you unsettled tonight?
Home break-in turned murder.
I might have you beat.
I saw a man high on bath salts eating another man's face.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, exactly.
Oh, man, I'm starting to buy into all this full moon crap.
Still haven't seen no werewolves.
Okay, I got a Kathleen Blake, filed a complaint against her estranged husband Trent McConnell.
Yeah, that's-that's it. That's the one.
And I may have just found your witness.
That's weird.
What?
Nora Jane Curtis.
I had a P/R by the same name earlier tonight.
No, wait.
No, a different Nora Curtis.
This one's 30 years younger.
Wait, I took that call.
There was a prowler outside the house.
Except he wasn't outside, he was inside.
She just didn't know it.
Looked like a creep and peep.
Didn't want to scare her any more than she already was, so we suggested she spend the night someplace else.
Said she was gonna call her daughter.
The younger Nora Curtis?
<strong>Nora</strong>: This couch is fine for me, dear.
I will not put you out of your own bed.
Seriously, Mom, we're not having this conversation again.
I don't want you sleeping on the couch with your back.
( <em>Phone vibrating</em> )
Hello?
<strong>Abby</strong>: Uh, hi, am I speaking with Nora Jane Curtis?
Yes. Who is this?
This is Abby Clark, I'm a 911 operator.
I think I spoke to your mother earlier tonight.
You did. She's here.
Are you actually checking up?
That's so awesome.
It's the 911 operator.
Abby?
That is so sweet.
I didn't know they did that.
<strong>Abby</strong>: Something happened tonight to an acquaintance of yours, Kathleen Blake.
Kathy? She's not just an acquaintance.
She saved my life. What happened?
Uh, I'm so sorry, I can't disclose the details of that.
Can you tell me what you mean when you say she saved your life?
Mm, Kathy runs a support group for survivors of domestic violence.
She herself is a victim of abuse, and she gave me the courage to finally escape.
I mean, she even helped me rent a place where my ex couldn't find me.
Does your ex-husband know Kathy?
Yes.
She let me stay with her a few times when things got bad.
What's going on?
Okay, I need you to give me your address where are you right now, please.
Oh, God.
11207 Collins, North Hollywood.
<strong>Abby</strong>: The police think Kathy was attacked by her ex-husband tonight...
What's the matter?
But I think it was your ex-husband, and he's been looking for you.
Oh, my God.
It's him, he's here.
He found me. How did he find me?
Did he do something to Kathy?
Nora Jane, stay on the line.
Okay? Help is on the way.
<strong>Abby</strong>: Nora Jane?
( <em>Pounding on door</em> )
<strong>Man</strong>: Nora Jane!
What's happening, Nora Jane?
Nora Jane?!
Nora Jane!
He's in the house.
Police are two minutes out.
<strong>Man</strong>: I told you I'd find you, you b¡tch!
( <em>Man grunts</em> )
I don't know what's going on.
<strong>Man</strong>: I told you.
You can't hide forever.
( <em>Shouts</em> )
<strong>Nora Jane</strong>: I'm done hiding.
( <em>Whacking continues</em> )
( <em>Nora Jane grunting</em> )
Nora Jane?
Nora Jane?
<strong>Nora Jane</strong>: I think he's dead.
What?
What happened? Are you okay?
We're fine.
I was ready for him this time.
Thanks to you.
Good.
Good, well, help is on the way.
She's okay. Okay.
I'm sorry, did you say there's something inside you?
<strong>Man 2 ( <em>over phone</em> )</strong>: Connor?
( <em>Knocking on door</em> )
Connor, open the door, let me in.
<strong>Connor</strong>: Absolutely not. Go away.
Sir, are you in danger?
Is there someone trying to get into your house?
<strong>Connor</strong>: No! There's something inside of me. I can feel it.
Sir, what is your address, please?
I can feel it moving. What is happening?
What is your address, sir? I need your address.
<strong>Connor</strong>: Oh, what is happening?
There's a monster inside of me!
Damn it, Connor.
Let me in.
Go away.
You're scaring me.
Oh, <em>you're</em> scared?
I'm John Hurt in <em>Alien</em> right now.
Oh. Thank God.
( <em>Groans</em> ): Help.
Connor? 911's here.
Open the door now.
All right, step aside, sir.
Connor? Los Angeles Fire Department.
We can't help you if you don't open the door.
( <em>Connor whimpering</em> )
Connor, I don't want to have to break this door down.
( <em>Lock clicks</em> )
Can you tell me what you're feeling?
Something's happening. It's, like, the... like, the worst cramping pressure feeling that I've ever experienced...
It's like I'm gonna give birth or something.
Oh, stop it. We had sushi tonight.
He always orders the <em>omakase,</em> but he can't handle anyone telling him what to do, so he orders more...
You just have an upset stomach.
If you tell me I just have a stomachache one more time, I'm gonna stab you with your toothbrush.
I swear, I felt it moving, okay? I felt something moving.
How long have you been having the cramps?
Uh, about a week.
Yeah, I made a doctor's appointment for Friday.
Any other symptoms?
No.
Oh, he's been having a <em>lot</em> of gas.
Shut up!
You have.
I mean, i-it kind of builds like an overture, and then there's a nice little tuba solo.
It's a tremendous amount of horrible flatulence.
( <em>Whispers</em> ): Paul.
Okay, just lean back, let me have a look.
Okay.
Do you guys eat a lot of sushi?
He does... about four or five times a week.
I try to go carb- and fat-free as often as possible.
Ah, same here. You guys ever try the brown rice pasta?
You know, it's not that bad.
You know, it's a little gummy for my taste.
I see that.
Yeah.
Hey, what's your body fat percentage?
I swing between, like, 50...
Okay, can we finish the most interesting conversation of all time later?
( <em>Muffled grunt</em> )
Does this hurt?
Does that feel tender?
No.
What about your bowel movements? Any diarrhea?
No.
Yes. Why would you lie to him about that? He's trying to help you.
<em>Okay.</em> Sorry. Yes.
He has poop shame.
Okay. Just take a deep breath, okay? Relax.
( <em>Groans</em> )
Take a deep breath.
( <em>Taking deep breaths</em> )
Oh, my God! No, no, no!
I'm gonna burst! I'm gonna explode!
( <em>Groans</em> )
Let's get him in the ambulance right...
( <em>Yelling</em> )
( <em>Siren wailing</em> )
( <em>Yelling, grunting</em> )
God, just make it stop!
Drive faster. I feel like I'm gonna explode all over the place.
All right, Connor, you're doing great.
We're almost to the hospital. They're gonna do a scan, figure out exactly what's going on.
Th-There's something under my leg.
It's just the IV tube, all right? It's underneath you.
No, no, no, it's moving. There's something moving under my leg.
All right, let's turn him and check it out.
( <em>Whimpering</em> )
Oh!
What?
What the hell is that?
What?
That's a tapeworm.
Tapeworm? I have a tapeworm?!
Wait, it's coming out of his...
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, get it out. Get it out!
Oh, I can see the mouth.
I mean, we can pull it out.
No. No, no, absolutely not.
We're almost to the hospital... They're gonna remove that with the proper instruments, put him on some albendazole, and then we call it a night.
No, please, no. I can't take those drugs.
They're toxic. They put me on Flagyl for diverticulitis once, and it gave me severe heartburn and turned my pee burnt sienna.
I'm sorry, burnt sienna?
It was brown! Okay? It was dark brown.
Now, just please, I am begging you, get it out!
It's all you, Buck.
Really? So you have no problem delivering a baby, but this creeps you out?
Seniority has its advantages.
Just get it out...
Okay.
What are you waiting for? Get it out.
I have to be careful, all right?
If it breaks, it'll crawl back inside and regenerate.
Oh...
I'm definitely gonna puke.
I knew you didn't go from a 34 to a 31 waist with sit-ups.
Tapeworms are an old fashioned model's trick for losing weight.
You know, these things can live inside of you for, like, 20 years?
Ugh!
<strong>Paul</strong>: This is insane... it's like a magician's handkerchief.
Actually, it kind of makes perfect sense.
All the sushi you guys eat.
It's like playing Russian roulette with parasites.
And with the moon... Parasitic breeding cycles rise and fall with the full moon.
Will you shut up about the moon?
I honestly don't know how you're so calm about this.
It's nature, you know?
Circle of life.
<strong>Paul</strong>: Yeah, I don't think that's what Elton John had in mind when he wrote that.
Man, this has to be, like... six or seven feet.
Oh, God.
Have you been worn down lately? This thing has been stealing all your nutrients.
How do you know so much about tapeworms?
I tended bar one summer at a surf beach in South America.
These things are as common... as...
( <em>Pops</em> )
( <em>Yelling</em> )
Housecats.
Oh, God.
Whoa.
Congratulations, Connor.
It's a boy.
Abby?
Hi, Detective.
Ms. Clark, I'm, uh... well, I'm glad I caught you before you left.
I, uh...
Well, I wanted to apologize in person.
Oh.
You didn't have to do that.
No, I do. Uh, I had the wrong man, you tried to tell me, and... I didn't listen.
And I still can't figure out how you put all the pieces together.
I had a lot of help.
And... I do think it was lucky that I got that first call from the intended victim's mother.
Other than that, I'm not really sure how all the pieces go together, either.
Well, we think the suspect broke into the mother's house probably expecting that's where his ex-wife was staying.
And once he found she wasn't there, well, he went to the person he held responsible for her leaving.
Kathleen Blake.
Yeah. We found her laptop in his car... that's... how he got the address.
I mean, I'm just glad he didn't do the same thing to Nora Jane's mother.
Well, Nora Jane says her ex always liked the old lady, had a... well, a soft spot for her.
People are strange.
That's one way of looking at it, yeah. ( <em>Chuckles</em> )
Yeah.
Well, thank you again.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
Yeah.
