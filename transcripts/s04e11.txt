She was in the car, waiting for Don.
She just hung up...

I'm sure she's out of surgery.
<strong>Josh</strong>: No.
She'd want me here.
&quot;The calls don't stop, and we can't, either.&quot;
Did she say anything to you when you were there?
No. She, uh, she just kept on saying &quot;911.&quot;
I don't know how this place runs without her.
It's got you.
And it's got all of us, and we're not gonna let her down because we all owe Sue a lot.

That mother came to us for help, and they couldn't be bothered.

They'd, like, you know, play basketball with the kids, do little dances with them.
Always coming to the cookout, so to speak.
But to this day, I have never seen police hooping with kids in Beverly Hills.

You know, giving Nia back was the hardest thing I've ever done.

And not just because I loved her as my own, or that she had become part of the family.
It was the fear that she was going back into a bad situation.
That someone would hurt her, and I wouldn't be there to protect her.

I have to accept that I can't protect her anymore.

Nothing. Must've scared him off.
Dispatch, this is 118...
<strong>Bobby</strong>: <em>Dispatch, 118,</em> we are at the container with the victim.
Copy. Advise the boxcar number?
Container box number...
228, copy.
(<em>indistinct radio chatter</em>)
Fresh bruises on her wrists, Cap.
Pretty hard to tell how long he's had her in here.
<strong>Hen</strong>: Not labeled.
Could be fentanyl or Ativan or bleach for all we know.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: And how many injections?
She's about to stop breathing any second now.
Prep the naloxone. If it's not an opioid, one dose will not hurt her.
And it could actually help.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: She's got severe dehydration. Pushing fluids.
<em>Dispatch, backup has arrived.
<strong>Josh</strong>: Copy, units on scene</em> searching the area for the suspect who's possibly still in the general area.
One gigantic area.
Let's contain this container yard, shall we?
Units, let's set a perimeter.
5-Adam-32, take the northwest corner.
5-Adam-38, take northeast.
<em>5-Adam-19, show you taking southeast.</em>
5-Adam-26, on southwest.
Units, with your direction of travel, update dispatch with container box numbers.
Once in place, notify dispatch and begin to circle back to unit 228.
She's almost ready, Cap.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Okay, good.
5-Adam-26. On the move to containers 101, 87 and 97.
5-Adam-38, report?
5-Adam-38. We're at the northeast corner, clocking containers 264, 263, 259.
5-Adam-19, what's your location?
5-Adam-19.
We're at box numbers 282, 290, 301.
5-Adam-32, report.
Copy. We're at container 94, 96, 99.
No visual yet.
Anyone got a bird up? Need a bird.
On that. Calling air support.
(<em>overlapping chatter</em>)
255...
570...
<em>358...</em>
(<em>overlapping chatter continues</em>)
<strong>Williams</strong>: Halt!
<strong>Branford</strong>: Dispatch, we've got movement.
<em>We have visual of the suspect, several rows away.</em>
<strong>Williams</strong>: In pursuit.
<strong>Josh</strong>: <em>5-Adam-32,</em> update your location.
<strong>Williams</strong>: 5-Adam-32 at container number 35, but we lost visual.
<strong>Branford</strong>: We could really use air support's eyes in the sky.
Ascertaining with Piper Tech an ETA on the air unit.
No ETA yet for the helicopter.
They'll call us back with an update.
<strong>Officer</strong>: Suspect in sight near unit 85.
SWAT has been activated.
But they're ten minutes out.
<strong>Branford</strong>: We lost visual of the suspect.
<strong>Williams</strong>: Dispatch, I think we're lost.
We're in a maze.
Lots of the same thing in every direction.
Linda? ETA on my bird?
They're saying they're unavailable.
Negative. Tell them I've got an armed suspect and officers who are as good as sitting ducks.
I need an aerial visual assist.
<strong>Officer</strong>: <em>Dispatch, we're blind down here. We need eyes in the sky.</em>
<strong>Officer 2</strong>: <em>Dispatch, we're all turned around. Not even sure where we're at anymore. Dispatch... We lost visual.</em>
Location, location, location.
First rule of dispatch, I don't have theirs, and I just have to make do?
We are their eyes in the sky.
<strong>Branford</strong>: <em>We're at container 94, 96, 99.</em>
<strong>Josh (<em>echoing</em>)</strong>: <em>Partial perimeter, direction of travel...</em>
<strong>Williams</strong>: <em>87 and 97...
<strong>Josh</strong>: Numbers.</em>
<strong>Officer</strong>: <em>Clocking containers 264, 263, 259.</em>
<strong>Josh</strong>: <em>Breadcrumbs in the form of box numbers.</em>
(<em>overlapping chatter</em>)
<strong>Branford</strong>: <em>We're at container 94, 96, 99...</em>
Yes.
5-Adam-32, advise the container box numbers you're near and where the suspect was last seen.
We're near number 90.
<strong>Josh</strong>: <em>We are their eyes in the sky.</em>
No.
118, what's your status?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Dispatch, 118 is ready to move the victim.
Negative, negative. Hold your location.
Dispatch? Officers on the scene have advised area is clear.
<em>Negative.</em>
Suspect is circling back.
Close yourself inside, hunker down.
(<em>bullets ricocheting</em>)
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Everybody down!
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Cap, you okay?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I'm okay, thanks to...
Dispatch, we are taking fire.
Units, 118 taking fire at box number 228.
Repeat, shots fired at fire personnel.
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
<strong>Branford</strong>: 5-Adam-26. We're on our way.
Copy, westbound direction of travel.
5-Adam-32, be advised, suspect is headed your way.
SWAT's en route, one minute before they head out outside the yard.
It'll be over by then.
Our firefighters, they don't have guns or-or bulletproof vests.
Adam-19, show you responding from southeast.
38, show you en route.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Cap, we're losing her.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: We need to transport the victim now.
5-Adam-26, circle back to boxcar 432.
<strong>Branford</strong>: <em>We lost visual of the suspect.</em>
38, continue a southwest trajectory.
(<em>echoing</em>): 5-Adam-32, <em>change direction of travel to southbound. 5-Adam-38, take northeast. 26, circle back to container 80. We're gonna box him in.</em>
<strong>Branford</strong>: No visual yet.
<em>Northeast corner's clear. No sign of him.</em>
19, hold your position. He's locked in <em>on three sides.</em>
<strong>Branford</strong>: Holding our position.
<strong>Williams</strong>: Holding our position.
32, he's headed your way.
All units, we have him surrounded.
<strong>Branford</strong>: <em>Wait, we have movement.</em>
Drop it!
<strong>Williams</strong>: 5-Adam-32.
We're out with the suspect. One at gunpoint.
<strong>Branford</strong>: Dispatch, suspect in custody.
Code 4.
(<em>exhales</em>)
Copy. Code 4.
Suspect in custody.
118, officers advising the scene is now clear for transport.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Dispatch, 118 is on the move.
And thanks, for having our back.
That's why we're here.
(<em>elevator bell dings</em>)
(<em>indistinct chatter</em>)
Josh Russo?
I'm Sue Blevins. (<em>grunts</em>)
(<em>laughs</em>)
<strong>Josh</strong>: You're you.
The voice that saved my life.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So that call, which was, like, the worst moment of my life, that was just a day that ends in Y for you.
(<em>both chuckle</em>)
Well, we're not quite that blasé about it, but yes, that's the job.
You're really good at it.
How did you know to send me upstairs?
Well, initial fire call came from two floors below, that's why you could smell the smoke.
I was afraid that the stairwell was fully engulfed.
So sending you to an unfinished floor, well, it seemed safer than asking you to walk through fire.
Though, as it turns out, you were willing to do that to help a stranger.
(<em>scoffs</em>) Still not sure where that came from.
I've never been the heroic type.
Well, all evidence to the contrary.
I'm just a freelance stenographer.
It's a real thing.
Oh.
That I kind of don't want to do anymore.
Not sure what I'd do instead.
Well, you have experience listening and typing all day.
Maybe you want my job?
(<em>laughs softly</em>)
But only if we can do something about these chairs.
(<em>both laugh</em>)
Sweetie, you're gonna need some time.
I know you don't think so. You g...
(<em>knocking on door</em>)
<strong>Josh</strong>: Heard you were awake.
Finally.
Josh.
Come on in, kid.
Look, I'm trying to talk this one into taking a few weeks off, but all she wants to do is talk about going back to work.
Help me talk some sense into her.
<strong>Josh</strong>: Please. She doesn't know how to not work.
I mean, who tries to stop a kidnapping off duty?
Well, it wasn't as if I planned it.
No, Josh, we-we have to put our foot down.
The call center is not a tourist attraction.
I appreciate the councilman's interest, but we can't have him and his cronies parading through the office.
No, just tell him no, please.
Listen, uh, let me call you back.
No. No, no, no, no, no!
No, no! Wait! W-W-Wait!
(<em>tires screeching</em>)
Stop! Stop!
Is the girl okay?
She's safe.
(<em>exhales</em>)
Thanks to you.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Ransone.
<strong>Avery</strong>: Where's Tracie?
<strong>Ransone</strong>: Looking forward to seeing you.
<strong>Tracie</strong>: Mom?
<strong>Avery</strong>: I'm here, baby.
(<em>indistinct P.A. announcement</em>)
(<em>door closes</em>)
♪ ♪
<strong>Athena</strong>: Heard she wasn't the first girl.
<strong>Ransone</strong>: Probably the third.
We got lucky.
We found her just in time.
<strong>Athena</strong>: I'm not sure how lucky she feels.
You changed your mind about me moving out?
No. I know that this is something that's important to you, but knowing that you're okay?
That's what's important to me.
So I've made a list of acceptable neighborhoods, what to look for in a building, what to avoid.
These are my conditions.
Oh. This is a lot of conditions.
Some are negotiable. Some are not.
Starting with no first-floor apartments, no balconies.
Also, once you've narrowed down the field, I want to take a look in person, meet your building manager.
Run a background check?
I just want to keep you safe.
I know.
<em>Tracie Webber is currently hospitalized with injuries described as significant but not life-threatening. And her kidnapper Patrick Ryan Boyd is in custody tonight. Boyd was apprehended after a massive effort by police, fire and EMS. Coordinated by the people Sue Blevins...</em>
Hey, uh, you're here, but you're on my TV.
I'm a rerun.
They aired the same segment at 10:00 and 11:00.
A gift from my boss. He wants to have lunch tomorrow.
Uh, maybe you'll get a promotion, huh?
Maybe, but that's not what we're celebrating.
No? Uh, okay.
What are we celebrating?
Justice.
For Tracie Webber and Sue Blevins.
I hear they're both gonna be okay.
(<em>laughs softly</em>)
<strong>Josh</strong>: Welcome back to Sue!
(<em>applause</em>)
(<em>cheering</em>)
(<em>whooping</em>)
All units stand by.
Dispatcher with I. D. number 17, advise your status.
(<em>Sue exhales</em>)
Dispatcher Blevins... back in service.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: <em>Dispatcher Blevins...
<strong>Others</strong>: Welcome back!</em>
<strong>Buck</strong>: <em>Oh, Sue, it's good to hear your voice.</em>
<strong>Hen</strong>: <em>Welcome back, Sue.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: You rock, Blevins. Welcome back.</em>
<strong>Man</strong>: <em>It wasn't the same without you.</em>
<strong>Woman</strong>: <em>We missed you.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Glad to have you back, Blevins.</em>
<strong>Woman</strong>: <em>Welcome back, Blevins.</em>
<strong>Man</strong>: <em>It's great to have you back.</em>
Thank you, everyone.
You're not gonna get rid of me that easy.
(<em>laughter</em>)
(<em>laughs, sniffles</em>)
Now back to work.
(<em>phone ringing</em>)
911. What's your emergency?
