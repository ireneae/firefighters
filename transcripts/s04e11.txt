All you got to do is hang on.
Push through the pain.
"911," all-new Mondays.
And watch other Fox shows like "Lone Star," "Prodigal Son," and "The Resident" on Fox.
Oh, she'll like some flowers.
Yeah. Oh, uh...Uh, hey there.
I-I'm sorry to bother you. Would you mind keeping an eye on my cart for a minute?
Daffodils are my wife's favorite.
Pretty sure they put this thing outside so you could grab your flowers on the way in to the store.
I-I'd just really like to surprise her. She's waiting in the car.
I promise, it'll only be a minute.
I'm not supposed to, but make it quick.
Thank you.
<i>No.</i> We-we have to put our foot down.
The call center is not a tourist attraction.
I appreciate the councilman's interest, but we can't have him and his cronies parading through the office.
No, just tell him no, please.
Listen, let me call you back.
It's fine. Go on right ahead.
No, no, no, no!
No, no, wait! W-W-Wait!
Stop! Stop!
God, no!
Ma'am, are you okay?
I've got a pulse.
Oh, my God.
You said you were gonna stay in the car.
She's alive.
I-I'm calling 911. W-Wait, start with the address.
Always give the address first.
Car was parked over by the dumpster.
He hit the gas, then he hit her. Looked pretty bad.
And he just took off? Didn't even slow down.
Hey, you're gonna be okay, sweetie. Okay? Help is here.
You're gonna be fine, okay? Everything...Sir?
Sir, why don't you just step back, let my team have a look.
One, two, three.
Airway's clear, but her breathing's labored.
Definitely a broken femur here.
I know her.
What?
It's Sue Blevins.
From the call center. Yeah. Maddie's boss.
Head injury is pretty severe. Pupils are uneven.
Possible subdural hematoma. Oh, man. Oh, boy.
We need oxygen over here.
Oh, come on, Sue. We can run an IV en route.
Sue, can you hear me? Oh, come on, Sue.
Most likely a broken rib, maybe two.
Oh, come on.
Probable punctured lung, as well.
Let's get her on the board. One, two, three.
Oh, man.
Oh, come on, Sue. Come on.
Nine...
One...
What's she saying?
Nine...one...
911?
We're here, Sue.
We got you.
Nine...one...
He was inside buying flowers for her while someone was trying to kill her.
Thought this was an accident.
The guy never took his foot off the gas, like he wanted that lady dead.
SUE Nine...one...
And I'm gonna need some new sneakers.
Mine are getting too small.
What? Didn't we just buy you those?
It seems like all we have to do is buy a pair of sneakers for his feet to shoot up to the next size.
Yeah, it's a vicious cycle.
He's growing up.
And you both have done a fantastic job raising us.
Letting us be our own independent people.
This conversation just took an unexpected turn.
To the scripted side.
I think it's time I got a place of my own.
You're moving out? This is gonna be great.
I-I've got a job. Money in savings.
I'm ready to live on my own.
Well, this is a big step.
Mm-hmm.
Are you sure you're ready?
I am.
Well, okay, then.
Really?
Yeah. Really?
Well, it seems like you've given this some thought, and you're an adult.
Free to make your own decisions.
Okay. Okay. All right, well, if you're really serious about this, there are a few vacancies in the building across the street from me. Mm.
Oh, with the telescope view.
No.
Good morning, everybody. Hey.
Morning.
You missed the big announcement.
Oh?
Everything okay?
Yeah.
You're late.
Well, I was just checking up on a case from last night.
It was a hit-and-run. Victim was Sue Blevins.
<i>It doesn't make</i> any sense. Who would want to hurt Sue?
A security guard only saw the accident.
Didn't know what happened before.
Maybe some kind of parking lot rage thing?
I was talking to her.
Last night, we were on the phone.
She was in the car, waiting for Don.
She just hung up...
Oh, God.
I-I've got to call Don. He must be beside himself.
Well, do you want to go to the hospital?
I'm sure she's out of surgery. No.
She'd want me here.
"The calls don't stop, and we can't, either." Did she say anything to you when you were there?
No. She, uh, she just kept on saying "911." I don't know how this place runs without her.
It's got you.
And it's got all of us, and we're not gonna let her down because we all owe Sue a lot.
I owe her my life.

Have a website and everything.
Why don't I show you where you'll be working.
Sorry about the mess. And thanks for coming in so late.
When we scheduled you to come in, we thought we'd be a little more settled.
Just need a quiet space, a power outlet and an ergonomic chair.
You do have one of those, don't you?
It's four days of planning sessions from the partners' retreat.
I'd have called you earlier, but it took us all day just to find them.
We'd transcribe them in-house, but the partners can get a little salty.
I got no problem with a little salt.
Just usually prefer it with a wedge of lime and a good glass of tequila.
But not while I'm on the clock.
I'll leave you to it.
Oh, and we might be here after hours, but I don't know how late.
Oh, it's fine. I'm a night owl.

Hello?
Is anybody still here?
Damn it.
<i>...this building before, and I don't know what to do,</i> <i>and I-I'm kind of freaking out here.</i> It's okay.
Take a deep breath.
We're gonna get you out of there.
I don't know, Michael.
If you have concerns, maybe you should discuss them with your daughter.
Yes. Without me.
Okay. Talk later.
Michael's worried about May moving into her own place?
He thinks we should talk her out of it.
Have a family meeting. Present a united front.
I said no, thank you.
Hmm.
You're surprised.
Well, it just seems like...
A fight I would have with my daughter? I know.
No, Athena, that's not what I was gonna say.
It wasn't gonna be a criticism.
Well, maybe it should be.
I keep thinking about the argument she and I had about Laila.
And that's not the relationship I ever wanted to have with my daughter. She's just too much like me.
And if I try to hold on too tight, I'm just gonna drive her away.
Athena, you are not Beatrice.
You're not your mother.
In that moment, it felt like I was.
<i>Hey, so,</i> what do you know about the 911 call center?
Uh, next to nothing.
Your sister works there, right?
Yeah, she does. Uh, her boss, Sue, is really great.
She's actually been at the call center since it opened.
Since the '60s?
No.
That's-that's when they created the number. Call center here in L. A. didn't open till 1984.
And did you know dispatchers aren't even classified as first responders in most parts of the country?
Which is crazy.
Uh, only changed here in California last year.
Interesting.
Yeah?
Hey. So, um, the other night, Sue was hit by a car.
Uh, driver just took off.
That's awful.
Did you know less than ten percent of hit-and-runs ever get solved?
Yes, though it doesn't feel like you're just citing another interesting fact now.
So, police have no leads.
I checked.
And I figured maybe the public could help, but the public would need to know about the hit-and-run.
Oh.
Maybe if they saw it on the news?
It just so happens I have, uh, a friend who's also a fantastic reporter.
And I-I thought maybe she could do me a favor.
If I'm gonna sell this to my assignment editor, I'm gonna need a better hook than just a hit-and-run.
Okay. Uh, like what?
Tell me more about the call center.
<i>Sue took a pretty bad hit.</i> A concussion, plus some pretty severe internal injuries.
But she's out of surgery, and Don says she did well.
God. I think I took that call. I didn't know.
There's no way for you to know.
Woman who called it in never said Sue's name.
What about the guy who hit her?
Police are still looking.
I'm...I'm not sure what else we...
Uh, if people need someone to talk to?
Yes. Counselors are available if anyone needs to talk.
And I'm here if you need anything.
I'll update you as I get more information, but until then...
Just keep Sue in your thoughts.
Okay.
<i>Josh, don't go any further, okay?</i> I need you to climb. Go up.
No...
Up?
No, that sounds like a really stupid idea.
<i>Doesn't smoke rise?</i> I should go down.
Yeah, I'm going down. <i>-Don't.</i> Listen to me.
The fire.
I think it's coming from the floor below.
What do I do now?
<i>Sir, you need to calm down.</i> <i>No! This woman is trying to kill me!</i> I thought you said she was blocking your car in?
Yeah, she is, with a baseball bat!
Get out of that car and tell me where my child is!
I told you, I ain't seen Tracie in a month.
I swear fore God, Keith, I'm not playing with you!
Probably longer.
Liar!
Come on out, coward!
If you hit that vehicle, I have to arrest you.
Oh, thank you.
My daughter's missing!
I know he did something to her!
I understand you're upset, but getting yourself arrested will not solve anything.
Why are you talking to her?! She's been terrorizing me for the past half an hour. You need to arrest her!
Shut your mouth and that window.
Tell me about your daughter.
Tracie. Just turned 21.
She's been gone for two days.
Hasn't been home, hasn't been to work.
Her friends haven't heard from her.
I'm losing my mind here.
You think he knows where she is?
She broke it off with him a few weeks back.
And he's not the type who likes to be told "no." Talk and don't even think about lying to me.
Uh, I don't know where she is.
I haven't seen or talked to her in weeks.
Where have you been the last two days?
Moving into my mama's basement.
A million people saw me there.
I'm gonna need you to start making a list of those million people.
Okay.
Did you file a police report?
They asked me if I was sure she didn't just run away.
Then they said they'd get back to me.
I'm not holding my breath.
Didn't seem like my girl was a high priority.
Well, she is now.
Hey.
You looking for me?
You know there's nothing in that case file aside from a photo and the initial statement from her mother?
This is Nelson's case, right?
Would be if he were working it. Instead, he decided to wait and see.
Maybe she'll just come back on her own.
She's not the kind of missing girl that makes the evening news.
Solid job, solid family.
No history of drugs or alcohol.
Oh. There's an ex.
Yeah, with an alibi.
I was gonna go by her place of business, talk to the folks there.
Well, you want some company?
I'm sure Nelson won't mind.
I'm sure Nelson won't notice.
<i>Sue Blevins remains in ritical condition at this hour. c</i> <i>Police currently have no leads and fear</i> <i>this case could end up like most hit-and-runs</i> <i>in our city-- unsolved.</i> This is great. Maybe now they'll catch this guy.
I still can't believe the driver just took off.
Yeah. Happens all the time.
People getting away with murder.
Sue's not dead, Jamal.
She's gonna pull through.
<i>Crash cart</i> coming in!
Starting compressions.
All right, O2 sats. Inject her, perfusion.
Still no pulse.
All right, let's prep her for moving out.
Don?
I was sitting with her, waiting for her to wake up, and I thought she was starting to speak, and then, this alarm went off, and everybody came rushing in there.
Go! Go!
Watch out! Coming through!
Where are you taking her?
Emergency surgery.
She's bleeding internally. The doctor'll explain in a second.
Is she gonna be okay?
We'll do our best.
It's all right. It's all right.
Josh, I need you to climb. Go up.
<i>Doesn't smoke rise?</i> I should go down.
Yeah, I'm going down. <i>-Don't.</i> Listen to me.
Oh, God.
Someone else is here.
In the stairwell?
There's a woman.
I think she might've fallen trying to get out of here.
Is she breathing?
I think so?
Fire's getting closer!
You need to get out of there, Josh.
I can't leave her. She could die.
Okay, here's what you need to do.
Roll her onto her back.
<i>Now push her up so she's sitting up.</i> <i>Get behind her and give her a hug.</i> <i>Grab her wrists and lift her to her feet.</i> <i>Don't use your back.</i> No, I'm lifting with my legs.
Learned that last year in the parking lot of IKEA.
Make sure her knees are locked so you can get in front of her.
<i>ut your back against her chest.
P</i> <i>Now bend your knees and lift her onto your back.</i> <i>Get her arms all the way</i> <i>-over your shoulders.</i> What now?
Move. Fast as you can.
<i>Don't go down. There should be less smoke</i> <i>-a few floors up.</i> Okay.
Heading up.
<i>A few more. You can do this.</i> I'm at 34.
You're almost there.
<i>Just passed 35.</i> 36. <i>-That's far enough.</i> <i>You should be clear of the smoke.</i> Just a few more steps.
What...What do I do?
Find a wall and help her slide down.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
<i>I think so.</i> <i>LAFD is en route and should be there soon.</i> <i>I'll stay on the line until they get there.</i> We got them. Here they are.
Can you walk?
M-Maybe.
Get up.
Checking for respiration and O2 sats.
Let's put her on two liters of oxygen.
You okay?
Thank you.
I'm the wrong guy to thank.
I just showed up after some Good Samaritan carried you up five flights.
Hey, Cap, where's our hero?
I think this lady wants to say thank you.
Long gone. On his way to the ER.
Sorry. Guess we just missed him.
<i>She's still in surgery.</i> Probably for the next few hours.
Don sent me home. He didn't want me up all night when I'm supposed to work tomorrow.
So maybe you should stay home.
I can't.
Look, I know that you want to take care of the place and all of us while she's not there, but you need to take care of yourself, too.
It's like she always says, "We've all got people we love out there.
The best thing we can do is our jobs." I remember you saying that to me.
I got it from her.
I got all my best stuff from her.
I'm really scared, Maddie.
Me, too.
But you know what?
W-We are just gonna have all the faith in her that she's had in all of us, right?
She's gonna pull through this.
<i>I didn't even know</i> there was a missing girls case.
Exactly.
That's the problem.
I'm a police officer, and I didn't know there was a missing girl.
That mother came to us for help, and they couldn't be bothered.
"Wait and see if she turns up." We wouldn't be waiting and seeing if that was a 20-something-year-old white woman.
We'd be out combing the streets.
Mm-hmm. You know, when I was a kid, the cops used to do a community outreach in my neighborhood.
They'd, like, you know, play basketball with the kids, do little dances with them.
Always coming to the cookout, so to speak.
But to this day, I have never seen police hooping with kids in Beverly Hills.
You know, it makes you wonder, why, why do they need to know us to do the job that they're paid for?
Tens of thousands of missing people.
And we just write them off.
You thinking about that little girl?
The one who disappeared when you were a kid?
No.
I'm thinking about my little girl.
May wants to move out, get a place of her own.
I bet you shut that down real quick.
Why does everybody think I'm such a hard-ass that all I know how to do is say no?
Don't answer that.
I told her it would be okay.
You know, giving Nia back was the hardest thing I've ever done.
Mm.
And not just because I loved her as my own, or that she had become part of the family.
It was the fear that she was going back into a bad situation.
That someone would hurt her, and I wouldn't be there to protect her.
Well, May's an adult.
I have to accept that I can't protect her anymore.
All the bad things that you see in the world, Athena, and your...your baby bird is trying to leave the nest?
You're allowed to be scared.
You know what scares me more?
Becoming that voice inside my daughter's head that makes her doubt herself.
Then don't.
Be the voice that teaches her to protect herself when the world doesn't.
If she wants to leave the nest...
be the voice that teaches her how to fly.
<i>But now, veteran 911 dispatcher Sue Blevins</i> <i>-finds herself in her own harrowing crisis.</i> You know her, right?
The hostage thing at dispatch last year?
Oh, we go further back than that.
<i>According to witnesses,</i> <i>Blevins was hit by a red Vero Galaxy,</i> <i>prompting a 911 call...</i> I checked the log.
Tracie signed out of the employee lot at 6:07.
I thought you were open till 9:00.
For sales. Service department closes at 6:00.
Girls are usually gone by 6:15.
The girls?
Meredith works the desk with Tracie.
It's like what I told Mrs. Webber.
We finished work. I was ready to leave.
She wanted to hit the ladies' room first, and so we said good night.
That was the last time I saw her.
Okay, good.
Now I want you to tell me what you didn't tell her mother.
What was she doing at a casino?
Winning, apparently.
Her coworker said she'd go a couple of nights a week, clean up playing poker.
So, what, she was hustling guys at cards?
I didn't say that. I said she was good.
Whatever the guys assumed about her skills, that's on them.
What about this guy?
They're talking, but she keeps a good distance.
Never looks at him.
I'm guessing they probably didn't come in together.
No...but they left together.
Mm. Hmm.
Too much to drink?
Waitress said she didn't serve her alcohol.
Two iced teas and a water.
She's clearly tipsy.
Right there-- when she leans down and grabs her purse.
He moves his hand. He put something in her drink.
And then walks her out the door.
Maybe we'll get lucky, and he'll drive towards the camera.
Who knew you were the optimistic type?
There he is.
Oh, plate's obscured. He must have one of those blocker covers.
Looks like a Galaxy. What do you think?
Burgundy or red?
Red.
That was definitive.
What's the time stamp on that?
8:47.
9:02.
A red Vero Galaxy spotted fleeing the scene.
What scene? Casino?
No.
Hit-and-run.
I think Sue Blevins saw our kidnapper.
Hey!
Got here as fast as I could. Y-You find something?
I talked to one of the security guards.
She let me see the parking lot surveillance footage.
There's something weird here.
Let me see.
Maybe I should just tell you.
Uh, why?
Because you know her.
Uh, come on, l-let me see anyway.
Wow, he, uh, he really didn't slow down.
I just can't figure out why she's running towards the car.
Maybe she saw something she wasn't supposed to.
Uh, she-she sees the guy in his car.
She gets out to confront him.
He runs her over.
But what could she have seen?
I mean, look at where the car was parked.
Only thing over there are the dumpsters.
You know, I-I heard about this illegal plastic surgery clinic a few months back.
Guy was tossing evidence in the dumpster.
What if our driver did, too?
Should we call the police?
Eventually.
I mean, we're already here.
I do happen to have gloves in my car.
on't even think about it, Buck.
D Oh, Athena!
Finally. Uh, you find anything in the dumpster?
We found a handbag and the I. D.
of the missing girl.
I still don't understand what this girl has to do with Sue.
Tracie Webber was kidnapped less than a mile away from the supermarket.
We think she might have been in the car that hit Sue.
That would explain why the driver was gunning for her.
So she couldn't tell anyone what she saw.
"911." Nine...one...
one.
When we got on the scene, Sue was trying to talk.
Don thought she was saying 911, but maybe it was about the car.
A license plate number?
They don't start with three digits, unless it's a vanity plate.
What if it wasn't a "one"?
More like a-a "wuh," you know?
Nine, one, "wuh." Okay, let's run it.
Red Vero Galaxy.
Partial plate.
Nine, one...
William.
Station lawyers are already on their way.
Might want to call your cameraman instead.
Yes.
<i>A kidnapping alert, statewide.</i> <i>Red Vero Galaxy. California license plate.</i> <i>Nine, one, William, Adam,</i> <i>Lincoln, Tom, Nora.</i> <i>Police now believe Blevins was hit while attempting</i> <i>to thwart a kidnapping in progress.</i> <i>The young woman's name is Tracie Webber.</i> <i>She was reported missing three days ago.</i> <i>he was last seen with this man, S</i> <i>Patrick Ryan Boyd...</i> <i>Pretty sure I saw that car.</i> <i>I think I just saw the car!</i> <i>I-I'm on the 405.

I think she's been drugged.
R. A. unit is en route.
Dispatch, 118 is on scene, at the gate.
Where exactly do you need us?
118, stand by at your location and stage until the scene is secure.
Copy that, staging.
It's been long enough, hasn't it?
Cap, that girl's been drugged.
We need to get in there.
Yeah, they got the suspect yet?
Officers now advising the scene is clear for you to respond.
Okay, let's move!
118, on the move, coming to you.
5-Adam-32, 118 approaching your location.
I thought it was this way!
Aren't they this way?
Did Dispatch give us a box number?
No. Hey!
Over here!
All right, guys, let's go! Let's get in there.
No sign of the suspect?
Nothing. Must've scared him off.
Dispatch, this is 118...
<i>Dispatch, 118,</i> we are at the container with the victim.
Copy. Advise the boxcar number?
Container box number...
228, copy.
Fresh bruises on her wrists, Cap.
Pretty hard to tell how long he's had her in here.
Not labeled.
Could be fentanyl or Ativan or bleach for all we know.
And how many injections?
She's about to stop breathing any second now.
Prep the naloxone. If it's not an opioid, one dose will not hurt her.
And it could actually help.
She's got severe dehydration. Pushing fluids.
<i>-Dispatch, backup has arrived. Copy, units on scene</i> searching the area for the suspect who's possibly still in the general area.
One gigantic area.
Let's contain this container yard, shall we?
Units, let's set a perimeter.
5-Adam-32, take the northwest corner.
5-Adam-38, take northeast.
<i>5-Adam-19, show you taking southeast.</i> 5-Adam-26, on southwest.

Once in place, notify dispatch and begin to circle back to unit 228.
She's almost ready, Cap. Okay, good.
5-Adam-26. On the move to containers 101, 87 and 97.
5-Adam-38, report?
5-Adam-38. We're at the northeast corner, clocking containers 264, 263, 259.

No ETA yet for the helicopter.
They'll call us back with an update.
Suspect in sight near unit 85.
SWAT has been activated.
But they're ten minutes out.
We lost visual of the suspect.
Dispatch, I think we're lost.
We're in a maze.
Lots of the same thing in every direction.
Linda? ETA on my bird?
They're saying they're unavailable.
Negative. Tell them I've got an armed suspect and officers who are as good as sitting ducks.
I need an aerial visual assist.

Josh Russo?
I'm Sue Blevins.
You're you.
The voice that saved my life.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So that call, which was, like, the worst moment of my life, that was just a day that ends in Y for you.
Well, we're not quite that blasé about it, but yes, that's the job.
You're really good at it.
How did you know to send me upstairs?
Well, initial fire call came from two floors below, that's why you could smell the smoke.
I was afraid that the stairwell was fully engulfed.
So sending you to an unfinished floor, well, it seemed safer than asking you to walk through fire.
Though, as it turns out, you were willing to do that to help a stranger.
Still not sure where that came from.
I've never been the heroic type.
Well, all evidence to the contrary.
I'm just a freelance stenographer.
It's a real thing.
Oh.
That I kind of don't want to do anymore.
Not sure what I'd do instead.
Well, you have experience listening and typing all day.
Maybe you want my job?
But only if we can do something about these chairs.
Sweetie, you're gonna need some time.
I know you don't think so. You g...
Heard you were awake.
Finally.
Josh.
Come on in, kid.
Look, I'm trying to talk this one into taking a few weeks off, but all she wants to do is talk about going back to work.
Help me talk some sense into her.
Please. She doesn't know how to not work.
I mean, who tries to stop a kidnapping off duty?
Well, it wasn't as if I planned it.
No, Josh, we-we have to put our foot down.
The call center is not a tourist attraction.
I appreciate the councilman's interest, but we can't have him and his cronies parading through the office.
No, just tell him no, please.
Listen, uh, let me call you back.
No. No, no, no, no, no!
No, no! Wait! W-W-Wait!
Stop! Stop!
Is the girl okay?
She's safe.
Thanks to you.
Ransone.
Where's Tracie? Looking forward to seeing you.
Mom?
I'm here, baby.
Heard she wasn't the first girl.
Probably the third.
We got lucky.
We found her just in time.
I'm not sure how lucky she feels.
You changed your mind about me moving out?
No. I know that this is something that's important to you, but knowing that you're okay?
That's what's important to me.
So I've made a list of acceptable neighborhoods, what to look for in a building, what to avoid.
These are my conditions.
Oh. This is a lot of conditions.
Some are negotiable. Some are not.
Starting with no first-floor apartments, no balconies.
Also, once you've narrowed down the field, I want to take a look in person, meet your building manager.
Run a background check?
I just want to keep you safe.
I know.

Uh, maybe you'll get a promotion, huh?
Maybe, but that's not what we're celebrating.
No? Uh, okay.
What are we celebrating?
Justice.
