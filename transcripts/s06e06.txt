Thank you. I don't usually have time for blind dates, but they kicked me out of the lab for some kind of facilities improvement.
It's very inconvenient. We're trying to push the boundaries of human knowledge and we got to stop for what, maintenance?
It's ridiculous. Thank you.
Now, tell me about you.

Han, what did you do? <i> What needed</i> to be done. <i> Set me up on a date</i> without even talking to me about it?

Your job is cool, too, Mama. I just can't go to work with you.
Oh, okay. I guess that makes me feel a little bit better.
Plus, you're not really a firefighter anymore.
Yeah.
Oh. Oh.
Oh. Oh, sorry.
It's-it's okay. I got it. I got it.
Oh, oh, oh. All right.
Here we go.
What...
These are your resignation papers.
Yeah.
I thought you resigned already.

Go talk to Bobby.
Then we can move on to the next chapter.
Dr. Wilson.
I'll go this morning.
Eat up, Denny. We got to get going.
When did you know you wanted to work in space exploration?
July 18, 1983.
My parents woke me up at 4:00 in the morning so I could watch Sally Ride become the first American woman to fly in space.
Did you want to be an astronaut?
Thought about it.
Just wasn't in the stars.
That was really bad, Mom.
(laughing) (laughing) I know. I know.
You could have humored me a little bit, though.

Good morning, Zainab.
Morning. Hey, Denny.
Hi.
Ready to see some science happen?
I got permission from the folks over at ADAM to take us over there to see a simulation later this afternoon.
An asteroid diversion mission.
They want to move an asteroid? Like<i> Armageddon?</i> Yes, but maybe don't say that when you see them. (laughs) Hey, you can put your stuff over there. Alvin won't mind.
(sighs) How is Alvin this morning?
Then you drop it.

BOTH: Science fight.
Guess I got to go break it up. Again.
Can I watch?
No. No kids in the lab.
(phone chimes) Oh. And also... no phones.
VICTOR: Everybody else is your problem.
I've been working on this project for five years now.
I'm telling you we cannot do that.
All I'm saying is this is our future, and we're gonna get left behind if we don't do something big.
VICTOR: No.
That's not that way it works. I think that policy should...

<i> KAREN:</i> <i> Hey, what's the problem</i> <i> this time, Victor?</i> Nothing.
Alvin reconfigured the collection compartment. He removed the witness tubes.
HITU: Okay.
Now I'm paying attention. The witness tubes are a crucial part <i> of the testing protocol.</i> What are the witness tubes?
They test the atmosphere at the collection sites for contaminants that might interfere with our test results. <i> KAREN: We've already</i> signed off on the interior dimensions.

Hi.
It's been a while.
Good to see you, Hen.
Yeah, uh, come on in.
(chuckles) Um, I don't see any foster kids, so I guess you're not here to do an emergency placement?
No, Karen already explained your situation, and I've taken you off of our emergency placement list.
And I've told her that I would drop this off.
She expressed some interest in hosting some outreach events even though you can't foster anymore.
Wait. What?
Mm-hmm.
Karen told you that we weren't fostering any more children?
She said you're starting your third year at medical school.
And that's a demanding schedule.
Yeah, but it's just another year or two.
And then, start your residency.
Life as you know it is about to change.
When do you send it into space?
Not for a few more years. We have to make sure every little thing about it is in perfect shape, and then we have to figure out the best way for it to complete its mission.
Karen?
Hmm?
I just experienced something odd with the high pressure tank.
What happened?
I was extracting a sample, but when I went to open the valve, I got shocked.
It's outside the parameters of my experience so I just...
so, I wasn't sure if I...
We need to stop using that tank immediately until the techs can get a look at it.
Did you tell anyone?
I just came to find you.
Okay, let's go.
Denny, let's go.
(muttering) (machine whirring down) Interesting.

YIM: Evacuation's in process. Damage seems to be confined to one of the labs on the southeast corner of third floor.
We don't know exactly what might have gone wrong at this point.
Where do you need us?
Split our manpower.
PFD will clear the rest of the building while your team contains any fires at the origin and sweeps for casualties from the initial blast.
Copy that. All right, guys, suit up. We're heading inside.
Isn't this where Karen works?
Yep.
Do you guys think Hen knows?
Yep.
Oh...
Mama!
Are you okay?
I-I'm okay, but Mom didn't come out with us.
I didn't want to leave, but Zainab said we had to go.
It's okay.
It was the right thing to do.
She was in the lab?
I think so.
Okay.
I'm gonna go inside and find Mama, okay?
You stay with Zainab.
What do we know?
Not much. We're headed inside now to put out some fires and look for survivors.
Okay. I'll suit up.
Hen, no, you're not going inside.

CHIMNEY: Complete amputation of the arm. We got to clamp that artery and make a junctional tourniquet.
Karen, are you injured?
Oh, nothing serious.
Just some bumps and bruises, a couple of cuts.
Hitu got the worst of it. Just focus on her.
She's tachycardic and hypotensive.

Okay. Tilt it that way. There you go.
Nice and steady.

Well, this is me.

You need to tell her no.
And what if I can't?
<i> Then she walked out.</i> CHIMNEY: So, what are you gonna do?

Okay.
See?
Teamwork.
We got this.
HEN: All right, easy.
(grunts) Slowly.
Oh...
Here we are.
We got you set up on the couch.
We made you a little recovery room (chuckling) so that you don't have to get up and move around as much.
Hen, I'm fine.
You are not fine, and don't try to argue with me about it.

You're on strict bed rest.
Don't make me give him a call.
♪<i> Don't be afraid...</i> ♪ Oh. (groans) I hate this part.
(Hen chuckles) And blowing up would have been a better part?
You know what I mean.
Endless hours of TV, book after book, magazine after magazine, just...
waiting for the body to heal itself.
Waiting is mind-numbing.
(chuckling) My wife.
The Eveready Bunny. (laughs) Well, I have to be.
'Cause my wife is starting year three of medical school.
And somebody's gonna have to pick up the slack around here.
I'm not.
I'm going back to work, not med school.
H... Hen, I-I'm gonna be back up on my feet soon.
You don't have to quit...
Listen, someone told me, recently, that my life as I knew it was gonna change completely.
Oh, okay. But we knew that, didn't we?
I'm not sure I did.
I mean, I was-I was dreaming of being a doctor, but I don't think I really considered the reality of what I'd have to give up or miss out on.
Being a firefighter, being a mom, being your wife?
That's what matters to me.
Grammy helped me make you a cake.
(chuckles) Thank you, sweetheart.
Come here.
I-I need another hug.
Are you gonna hug me every time I come into the room?
Yes. Yes, I am.
Did Mama tell you she's gonna be a firefighter again?
Oh...
Yeah, she did.
How do you feel about that?
I think her uniform's cooler than scrubs.
I mean, so, clearly, I've made the right decision.
(chuckles) Hen, are you sure?
That was your dream.
