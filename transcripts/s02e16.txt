I'’m just hoping I'm not the onewho gets fired this time.
What'’s going on?
BOBBY: Little something I like to call dinner.
Take a seat.
CHIMNEY: I didn'’t know you cooked, Cap.
It'’s been a while. I'’m a little rusty, so, you'’ll have to forgive me if not everything is exactly perfect.
If that tastes as good as it smells, [chuckling]: I'’ll forgive you for anything.
So what'’s the occasion?
No occasion. I'’m just starting a new tradition.
We here at the 118 work togetherand we eat together.
Every shift.
Family dinner.
I'’m in.

Yo.
Uh, hi. I'’m Evan Buckley, new recruit.
I was told to report to Captain Nash.
You know a Captain Nash? You?
You?
BUCK: Uh... Um...
Take a seat, Evan.
[laughter] Uh, Buck.
Ev-Everyone just calls me Buck.
Well, welcome to the 118, Buck.
Thank you.
Ah, this is amazing.
Is-Is it always like this?
Always.
Well, when Bobby'’s in the captain'’s chair, anyway.
I think I might be in the right place.
Hey, Cap. Why are you sitting uphere in your civvies?
And how come I am not smelling my breakfast? Heh.
Maybe you should all sit down.
Oh. This doesn'’t feel good.
All right. I know the shift'’s about to start, but I wanted to be here to tell you this in person.
As of this morning, pending further investigation, I am officially suspendedfrom my duties here at the 118.
What? Why? That-That'’s insane.
Suspended for what?
For not disclosing what happened in Minnesota before I took the job.
Minnesota?
That'’s old news.
Well, not to them, and if they knew all the details, there'’s a very good chance they never would'’ve hired me.
Cap, you don'’t owe them that part of you.
You owe them your record.
All the people you'’ve helped.
The lives you'’ve saved.
Well, I knew the truth would catch up to me one day.
I just figured by the time it did, it wouldn'’t matter.
I'’d have nothing left to lose.
I was wrong.
WOMAN: Captain Nash, you understand that you are entitled to have a union representative or attorney present?
I do.
And you also understand that this is not a criminal proceeding?
I do.
MAN: Captain Nash, the duty of this panel is to make a recommendation as to whether or not you should remain a member ofthe Los Angeles Fire Department, and anything you say to us will be used in making this determination.
I understand.
I just want to tell the truth.
