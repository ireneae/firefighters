Sir, you don't have to...
Victor?
What did you do?
He didn't do anything.
Yes, I did.
I set the fire.
Every month, we went deeper into the hole, and we were gonna lose everything.
I... I just thought a... big check from the insurance company would give us another shot.
Sir, I'm gonna have to take you into custody.
What were you thinking?
He was thinking of you. He was thinking of both of you.
My father is not a criminal. He's not a criminal!
Freddie, it's all right...
No, don't you touch me!
You said everything was gonna be okay. You lied.
<strong>Victor</strong>: Freddie, stop, stop, okay? I have to go with them now.
I have to go.
<strong>Freddie</strong>: Dad...
I love you! I love you both!
Okay, enough, Freddie.
You're supposed to save people.
Enough.
You're supposed to save them!
<strong>Bobby</strong>: He called me a liar.
And it stung.
Well, it sounds about right.
By your own admission, you're a hypocritical liar who lies a lot.
(<em>Chuckles</em>)
All right. All right, you made a joke out of that.
(<em>Chuckling</em>) Well, that's because it's funny.
But it's also true.
Your team. The other firefighters.
Do they know your past?
No.
I don't want them to.
Mm.
They're good people, good firefighters, and I ask everything of them.
To offer up all of themselves.
To trust that I can be in two places at once.
How's that?
In front, to lead them.
And behind them, to always have their backs.
I ask for their trust, and I can't give it back in return.
You don't have to tell them what you've done in order to show them who you are.
Bobby, you may have a plan, and that's all well and good.
But I have faith.
I have faith that God has a very different plan for you.

<strong>Bobby</strong>: Hey, listen up!
I want everybody upstairs ASAP.
Come on.
What do you think that's about?
I'm just hoping I'm not the one who gets fired this time.
What's going on?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Little something I like to call dinner.
Take a seat.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: I didn't know you cooked, Cap.
It's been a while. I'm a little rusty, so, you'll have to forgive me if not everything is exactly perfect.
If that tastes as good as it smells, (<em>Chuckling</em>) I'll forgive you for anything.
So what's the occasion?
No occasion. I'm just starting a new tradition.
We here at the 118 work together and we eat together.
Every shift.
Family dinner.
I'm in.

Yo.
Uh, hi. I'm Evan Buckley, new recruit.
I was told to report to Captain Nash.
You know a Captain Nash? You?
You?
<strong>Buck</strong>: Uh... Um...
Take a seat, Evan.
(<em>Laughter</em>)
Uh, Buck.
Ev... Everyone just calls me Buck.
Well, welcome to the 118, Buck.
Thank you.
Ah, this is amazing.
Is it always like this?
Always.
Well, when Bobby's in the captain's chair, anyway.
I think I might be in the right place.
Hey, Cap. Why are you sitting up here in your civvies?
And how come I am not smelling my breakfast? Heh.
Maybe you should all sit down.
Oh. This doesn't feel good.
All right. I know the shift's about to start, but I wanted to be here to tell you this in person.
As of this morning, pending further investigation, I am officially suspended from my duties here at the 118.
What? Why? That-That's insane. Suspended for what?
For not disclosing what happened in Minnesota before I took the job.
Minnesota?
That's old news.
Well, not to them, and if they knew all the details, there's a very good chance they never would've hired me.
Cap, you don't owe them that part of you.
You owe them your record.
All the people you've helped.
The lives you've saved.
Well, I knew the truth would catch up to me one day.
I just figured by the time it did, it wouldn't matter.
I'd have nothing left to lose.
I was wrong.
<strong>Woman</strong>: Captain Nash, you understand that you are entitled to have a union representative or attorney present?
I do.
And you also understand that this is not a criminal proceeding?
I do.
<strong>Man</strong>: Captain Nash, the duty of this panel is to make a recommendation as to whether or not you should remain a member of the Los Angeles Fire Department, and anything you say to us will be used in making this determination.
I understand. I just want to tell the truth.
