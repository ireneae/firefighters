("I Will Drink" by Pee Loon playing) WOMAN: Do you love him?
Ananya.
Is he nice?
Uh, I mean, you met him. You didn't think he was nice?
I mean to you. Is he nice to you?
Yeah, he's a good man.
How do you know?
PREM: You can't know.
Not everything, anyway.
I'll learn about her as we go.
But what if you don't like what you learn?
Well, then I'll pray.
For what?
The strength to understand him.
I'd pray for a good divorce lawyer.
Stop.
MAN: She's gonna change you.
Marriage is supposed to change you.
It's a good match.
We all should bless the newly-married couple now.
("Bhootni Ke" by Daler Mehndi playing) BUCK: 16 DOA so far.
Mostly blunt trauma to the head or crushed by falling debris or other bodies.
One victim impaled.
They fell through two stories.
I won't be surprised if that number goes higher.
HEN: Captain, the groom is devastated-- his bride hasn't been accounted for yet.
We'll find her. Buck, I'm gonna need you to go up top.
Access to the second floor is blocked.
We're gonna have to tackle this thing from both ends.
Okay, Captain.
Savita! Savita!
Savita!
Step back. Step back, it's okay.
If she's in there, we will find her.
Sir, stay back. Sir, let us do our job.
Savita!
Just have a seat, let us do our job.
MAN: Help!
In here!
Hey, I got you.
Ah. Here we go.
My leg...
I think it's broken.
Okay, you hang tight.
BUCK: I got you.
Here we go. We're good, we're good. All right.
Buck. Buck, get over here and give me a hand.
PREM: Savita!
BUCK: She's not moving.
BOBBY: All right, is she breathing?
BUCK: I think so.
Hey, she's coming to. You got it?
BOBBY: Yeah.
Hold on, stay still. Stay still in there.
Here. Here. We got you. Give me your hand.
Okay. Can you move?
All right.
Come on. Slowly, all right?
We got you. We got you.
We got you. Okay, got her.
Easy. Easy. Watch your head.
PREM: Savita.
All right.
Is the owner here?
Uh, that's him right there. Why?
Hey.
When'd you put on the third floor?
When did you put on the third floor?
You think I don't know what that is What...
That's Kal-Pal!
That stuff's been banned.
You didn't reinforce the concrete with steel.
Instead you used that crap.
This used to be a two-story building.
That floor that collapsed-- that was the roof, wasn't it?
Wasn't it?!
HEN: Bobby!
You know what you did, you son of a bitch!
You're going to jail. That's manslaughter!
HEN: Captain, Captain, Captain. !
Captain, Captain, come away. What is wrong with you?
Back off, Hen.
Not 24 hours ago, you were saying, "Help." What happened to that?
So, this wedding-- it's an arranged marriage.
That's a trip, right?
Can you imagine committing to someone you don't even know?
Does anyone really know anybody?
HEN: So how long they gonna have you chained to that desk?
ATHENA: Well, the Creedys are ready to drop their complaint-- you know, so long as the department drops the charges on their daughter.
Not even a little bit.
That girl is wicked.
How's May doing?
She's at home. I mean, it feels like we're back on solid ground.
If we ever were.
I swear, it's like I don't even know these people I'm supposed to be the closest to.
There's a lot of that going around.
Trouble at home?
Mm.
No, no, no. Not at home.
At least, not yet, no.
It's Bobby.
Clark Kent?
After the plane crash...
he went on a bender.
Didn't answer his phone for, like, two days.
Buck and I went over there to make sure he was still alive.
And can I tell you, there was not one single picture on the wall. Nothing, no sign of a family.
Nothing. It was just, it was weird.
This guy's been our captain for, like, over a year, and in all that time, he's never really talked about his personal life.
It's like he's got this invisible wall up.
What, you think his wife left him, took everything?
See, it didn't look like somebody had come and cleared out. It was more like...
nobody ever moved in.
Like he's not even really there.
Well, if you want, I'll do a background check.
I got nothing else to do all day anyway.
Nah. Bobby already got trust issues.
I don't want those problems. Nah.
And it's, you know... It's not like I'm saying that he's a bad captain.
Hell...
I think he's the best captain I've ever worked under.
But I'm starting to worry about him.
So... what'd you mean by "not yet"?
Before, when I asked if there was trouble at home, you said "not yet." I got a call this morning from Palmar Women's Correctional Facility.
What does she want?
To see me.
She said it's urgent. I feel like I owe it to her.
You don't owe her anything.
In fact, you got credit in that account.
You're right. But she didn't fight us when we wanted to adopt Denny.
I just don't want her making waves.
And what does your wife have to say about that-- you going to visit your ex at the pokey?
I haven't told her yet.
Look like Bruce Wayne isn't the only one with a few secrets.
MAN: Go, Pack, go!
JOE BUCK : A lot of big plays, week one...
Jamie, this is our roommate, Buck.
He's a fireman.
Oh! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yeah!
Give me some!
Boom!
That's what I'm talking about!
: Contact down the field.
Out of time outs!
They're trying to give Laquon Treadwell an opportunity. A lot of contact-- Treadwell's got his hands on him as well.
I got more flyers.
Oh, thanks.
Can you just stick them in here, please?
Hello?
Hey, it's Buck. I got your text.
Oh, hey. Um, yeah, I know, I just...
I sent a blast out to all my contacts.
Are you, are you okay?
: Um, no.
I'm not. I'm kind of having a nervous breakdown.
Um... h-how long's she been gone?
I don't know.
Maybe, like, nine hours or something.
She was gone when I woke up.
So I called, you know, I've called the police, I've called the hospitals, the shelters...
My brother's in Vegas. He's gonna try to get a flight back.
Look, I'm-I'm gonna come over.
We'll, uh, we'll find your mom and then we can go back to never seeing each other again, okay?
Thanks.
Hey, baby.
Uh...
Thanks for coming by.
: How long has it been, a year?
Sorry, I've-- I just, you know, I haven't been able to get back to see you. I'm sorry.
No, it's cool.
I mean, you got a life and a wife.
How's Diesel?
We, uh, we call him Denny.
None of my business, right?
You, uh, you said something about an emergency?
You don't want to take a minute, check in with your girl?
You're not my girl.
Yeah. Okay.
My parole hearing.
It's coming up soon and my lawyer says I've got a shot.
'Cause I haven't got in a fight in, like, two years, and I've been taking a bunch of accounting courses so...
What do you need from me?
I need someone to vouch for me at my hearing.
You are a respected member of the community, and maybe you could, uh...
maybe you could wear your uniform.
I mean, my lawyer says that I'm close, but someone like you would put me over the top.
I haven't seen you in over a year, Eva.
What would I even say?
You know me.
I mean, you know me better than anyone has ever known me.
And you loved me.
I mean, that time we shared together was the best part of my life.
And I've changed.
I'm... I'm not that troublemaker anymore.
You can see that, can't you?
Oh.
Um...
Abby.
Hi, Buck.
So what do we know so far?
Come in. Come-- yeah, come in. Thanks.
I'm Carla, by the way.
So we're here. I made assumptions based on her being on foot, because if she's on a bus, or in a taxi, then... she could have gotten much further.
No, this is good. This is really impressive.
What do you figure, like, two miles an hour Three.
Patricia's an annoyingly fast walker.
Yeah.
Even if she's been gone for nine hours, she couldn't have been walking the entire time.
I know. That's what I was thinking, so I figure, maybe 15 to 20 mile range, but then that seems too far, so I brought it down to 12.
But in any direction, so we would have just under 527 square miles to check.
But, I mean, literally, she could be anywhere.
I...
I don't know what to do.
I'm so much better when it's somebody else's emergency.
No one is good when it's personal.
But we got this, okay.
We're gonna find your mom. Promise.
Okay. How are we gonna do it?
One mile at a time.
Let's go find her.
Okay.
Come on.
All right.
CARLA: Thanks.
BOBBY: I'm lost.
Figured the only way for a guy like me to pull off leading a crew...
was by shielding them from my own personal damage.
How'd that work out?
It was fine for a while.
Left my baggage at home, made work about getting the job done.
It kept things focused.
But after you log in enough 48-hour shifts, actually living with your coworkers...
Withholding can become a challenge.
They've given me their absolute trust, and I've given them nothing in return.
That can always change, Bobby.
All it takes is a conversation, kind of like this one.
It's not that simple.
There are things about me they just can't know.
Things I can't risk following us out into the field.
You mean that you fell off the wagon?
No.
That I murdered my own family.
* * Fire till he is done in * But they catch you at the border * * And the mourners are all singin' * * As they drag you by your...
WEATHERMAN : Forecast, cloudy and windy and cold this morning, warming up a bit this afternoon, with a few sun sprays...
Daddy.
Brookie.
You smell minty.
Did I miss dinner?
Oh, and bath time and homework, but you're just in time for teeth-brushing and bed.
WEATHERMAN: The wind's out of the northwest at 14 miles per hour.
It's currently...
Dad. Dad.
You were falling asleep on the potty.
Oh, I'm just wiped out from work.
We had two fires, brought an old lady to the hospital, a false alarm and I had to wash the truck. Come on.
Do you want to hear what I told Mom in the car today?
BOBBY: What?
The best place to catch on fire is a firehouse.
Uh-huh.
And the best car to get hit by is an ambulance, and the best place to get robbed in is inside a police station.
Where'd you get such a beautiful brain?
Probably Target.
How was your day, bud?
Are you okay?
Has your back been hurting?
I can just always tell when your back is hurting you.
Listen.
Everything is gonna be all right.
I love you. You have sweet dreams.
I love you, too, Dad.
Good night.
Good night, Dad. Love you.
Good night. I love you, too.
BROOK: Sweet dreams.
I'm going for my walk.
Oh, it's-it's freezing out.
Yeah, just, if I don't go for my walk before bed, my back tightens up.
Eh, you know, maybe we should see another doctor.
I mean, why should you still hurt five years after you injured it?
All the doctors say the same thing, that I'm lucky to be walking.
A broken back never really fully heals, so...
All right. I'll...
Wait. Don't-don't go.
Babe, I'm-I'm gonna be right back, all right?
Ah, damn it.
Hey.
When we got married, I accepted the idea that when you went to work, you might not come home.
Baby, I just forgot my phone and then I lost track of time.
I was just walking.
I-I never really thought about what it was I was so scared of losing.
I mean, no woman wants to lose her husband.
You know, the-the love of her life, the father of her children.
: You're my rock, Bobby.
Sweetheart, I love you so...
No, no, don't touch me.
Okay, okay.
Don't.
You've been lying to me for months.
But it's so obvious.
Sneaking out and you're losing weight and falling asleep.
You know, but I didn't want to believe it because you were so adamant when you got out of rehab last year that that was, that was the last time.
There would be no relapses. And I thought you would never risk getting caught at work again and losing your job.
So what is it? I mean, I know about the booze, right?
But Is it pills? Is it heroin?
Just everything.
It's anything to make the pain go away.
Look, I took a fall about ten months ago.
I didn't want to tell you about it.
Because you knew I was gonna make you quit.
No. I-I was handling it.
I thought I was.
I had a-- look, I got a prescription.
Look, I thought I was handling it.
I just-- like you said, I'm your rock.
No. No, no, no. Don't you put this on me.
That's not what I mean.
I just, I'm not weak. I can beat this.
This is not who I am. This is not me.
All right? I'm strong. I am unbreakable.
I-I'm Superman. I go into burning buildings and I come out without a scratch.
That's me, not this.
And I don't know when it flipped over into addiction, but I... I got that prescription.
I didn't tell you about it.
And I just needed the OxyContin, and I started to need it more-- 24 hours a day-- and then if I couldn't get it, I went to get something else.
So what? So you would go to work high?
You would-- you'd drive our kids to school high?
I'm sorry.
I will get help. I will go back to rehab.
I'll do anything.
I don't want you here tonight.
You spend the night in your drug den or wherever. Then what?
I love you, Bobby. I don't-- I love you.
I'll forgive you for this, just... not tonight.
Oh.
(sirens wailing, fire truck horn honking) I'm right here. I'm right here. Do you think you can walk?
The alarms didn't go off. The sprinkler!
Try to stay calm. Can you walk?
All right, you stay here. I will come back before the smoke gets too thick.
No, wait, wait, wait.
Just stay right here. I will be back. Stay down.
Please!
Marcy?!
Bobby! Brook!
Marcy! Brook!
We have to evacuate. Come on!
Brook! Bobby!
Now!
Brook! We have to get up there!
My kids are up there!
We'll do what we can, okay? You need to get out of here!
Give me your gear. Give me your...
Get out of here! Let us do what we have to do!
Come on!
Give me your gear! Give me your gear!
Get this guy out of here!
Give me your gear!
Come on!
Give me your gear!
: Marcy?!
BOBBY: The super never mentioned who was using the apartment.
Guess he didn't want any trouble.
I don't understand.
How does a...
a space heater cause a fire like that?
The building was a death trap.
Nothing to code.
Cheap, flammable facade materials acted as an accelerant.
The sprinklers weren't hooked up.
You never noticed?
No.
Maybe now, sober, I would, but...
I chose to disappear.
Lived on pills and vodka for two years.
148 people died in that fire, including...
I killed them.
My own kids, my own family.
I murdered them in their sleep.
Choked 'em on smoke and I burned their little bodies.
Such a burden.
Such a burden, and you've been carrying this all by yourself all this time.
It's not the kind of story I want to share.
With your friends?
And your coworkers?
I'm their leader.
They have to trust me enough to follow me into situations where their lives are at risk.
There is no room... for them to doubt me.
You made a mistake, Bobby.
Every church is built on the possibility of human redemption.
God forgives more easily than people do.
You know, if you don't trust your friends to see and know you for who you are-- honestly, completely-- then you don't really have any friends.
Give them a chance.
You're allowed to be human.
: I just miss 'em so much.
So you about ready to tell me what's bugging you?
You're not gonna like it.
Something's bothering you. I don't expect to like it.
What is it?
Eva called. She's up for parole.
Great.
She asked me to speak on her behalf at the hearing.
Good.
You can tell the parole board that she's nothing but trouble, and needs to stay locked up and out of our lives.
Out of Denny's life.
HEN: Baby, I hear you, I do, but I really think she's made an effort this time.
She's done a lot of career education.
She's taken some accounting courses.
She's trying.
Have you been to see her?
Can't believe this.
She's not even out yet, and she's already got you sneaking around.
Karen, that's not fair.
Did she even ask about Denny?
Hmm?
Sort of, in passing.
She doesn't give a crap about him.
Good, good.
That's a good thing.
Because if she gets out, we don't want her involved in Denny's life.
That's why I went to go see her.
I don't want her-- we, we don't want to give her a reason to be vindictive.
She's really... she's not as bad as you think.
Baby... she's worse.
'Cause she will always be your first great love.
Oh, come on.
ATHENA: Yeah, I see your BOLO right here-- Patricia Clark, 75-year-old white female.
They got me riding a desk right now, but I'll keep my ears open.
Thank you, Sergeant.
She won't let us down.
And we have this.
So if a call comes in about your mom, we can be first on the scene.
Kind of a bummer we had to meet under these circumstances.
I mean, especially with our "only on the phone" plan.
Worst first date ever, right?
I've probably had worse.
Well, I mean, to be honest, it's a little fuzzy.
It's been a while since I've been out on a date.
How long Try more like almost a year.
What? I mean, that's not possible.
Who do you have sex with?
You've not had sex in almost a year?
No, I haven't had sex in-in-in a year...
... probably.
: Oh, my God.
I didn't say that.
Although, I am more a, you know, human contact, you know, touch of skin kind of person.
It's just really hard to feel sexy with your mom dying in the dining room.
MALE DISPATCHER: Respond to 800 Comstock Ave.
TA into power pole.
High-voltage wires down in swimming pool.
Three-year-old child trapped.
That's, like, two blocks from here.
Truck's been dispatched. They got it.
Yeah, but it'll take 'em eight to 12 minutes to get there.
I mean, this I know, 'cause I do it every day.
We should go.
Can't just pass it by.
Come on.
You guys okay? You okay?
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy.
WOMAN: Help! Help!
Just came out of nowhere.
WOMAN: I need help!
All right, we should go.
We should go. Go.
WOMAN: Help!
WOMAN : Help!
WOMAN: Help! Someone help!
Can you please help me? Please help.
There's a power line that fell into the water, and Alex jumped in to try to save the baby.
He's the manny.
Manny.
: Oh, my...
MAN: Lyla!
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Stay back.
Stay back. Stay... What are you doing?
Get off of me!
No. Hey, hey, I'm a firefighter, okay?
You can't see it, but those power lines are sending 5,000 volts through that water.
Anyone touches it and they are dead.
Okay, listen, listen, I understand. It's okay.
I'm gonna help.
Okay.
LYLA: Mama!
You and your wife do everything you can to make sure she stays on that float, okay?
Baby, listen, Mommy and Daddy are right here.
We're gonna come get you. Right now, okay, you have to stay...
Can we turn the power off ourselves?
No. Um...
Okay, stay there.
Sweetie, it's okay.
ABBY: What are you doing?
I'm, uh, I'm gonna ride this thing out and scoop her up.
No, you're not! Did you get that from the macho handbook?
That's insane.
Yeah, there's no way that book actually exists.
Actually, give me your knife.
You have a knife, right? You're a fireman.
Give me your knife.
Yeah, okay, okay.
Quick, quick, quick.
MAN: Okay.
ABBY: I think...
Here. Take this.
Okay, it's rubber, so it won't conduct electricity.
Okay, great. That's good. That's genius.
Okay.
Pull it across. Be careful.
Just go slow.
Okay, baby? Baby.
Do you see this?
Can you grab this for Mommy? Can you grab that?
Oh, you're such a good girl. Don't let go, okay?
Good job.
Oh, my God!
It's okay.
ABBY: It's okay, it's okay.
We're good. We're good.
Hold on. Hold on, sweetie.
Hold on tight.
There you go.
Oh, my God.
Hold tight.
Be careful, Buck.
Here we go.
WOMAN: You're doing such a good job.
Hold on.
Okay, keep holding. All the way over.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Don't go in the water.
WOMAN: Oh, my God.
MAN: Oh, my God.
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, please.
: Baby.
Oh.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Yeah.
DWP cut the power.
Thank you so much.
We're all clear.
Oh, my...
Great. Thank you.
Thanks, guys. How you doing?
Good job.
Good to see you. Thank you, man.
Good to see you guys. Yeah.
You, too.
You were so brave.
Okay.
Better. Better.
WOMAN: Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Good job.
Thanks.
What?
Nothing.
ABBY: That was so exhilarating.
I mean, I'm usually miles away on the other end of a phone.
You get to do that every day.
Such a high.
Well, you were really good.
Thanks.
I know.
Let's go find her.
Yeah.
So, um, you asked what I was looking at before, right?
When we, when we high It was your hands.
See, in an emergency situation, the body produces adrenaline.
Uh, keeps your mind focused, dulls any pain, makes you super strong.
It's a normal human response.
My first few calls, I was shaking like crazy for an hour after.
Your hands, they never shook.
I mean, you were like a full-on Jedi.
Well, I do have some experience with stress.
Sure.
But also, I feel calm around you.
Uh, hey. Sergeant.
Uh, did ATHENA: A woman fitting her description was brought into County General about 20 minutes ago.
Hey, Abby. Athena.
Hey, is she, uh... is she okay?
Doctor's looking at her now.
Yeah.
I'm Abby Clark.
You guys have actually met.
Abby was the 911 dispatcher on that home invasion in Winnetka.
Oh, no fooling. Okay.
Well, um, I'm still trying to get the story on what happened to her, but, um, seems like your mother made it all the way to South Los Angeles.
These fellas brought her in.
Um, thank you guys so much.
Was she hurt?
Nah.
She was confused and agitated.
She didn't belong there. You could tell.
So we brought her here.
I've seen it before with my abuelita.
And I'm sorry to say, but it doesn't get no better.
Thank you so much.
No problem. No problem whatsoever.
PATRICIA: Abby.
Mom.
Abby.
Mom.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.
It's okay, Mom.
Oh. Oh.
ABBY: It's okay.
Okay, Mom. Okay.
Okay.
Is this Tommy?
Did you cut your hair differently?
Mom, that's not Tommy.
Um, I broke up with Tommy. That's Buck.
He was the one who helped me find you.
Where did I go?
I'm just gonna walk him out, okay?
And I'll be right back. Okay.
I'm just... I'm...
Okay.
It was, uh, it was nice to meet you, Ms. Clark.
Thank you. Um...
Be kind to her.
ABBY: Okay. Um...
All right. Listen, now, be safe, okay?
Okay. Bye.
Take care.
Be right back.
So, that is the most amount of time I have ever spent with a woman I want to have sex with without actually having sex with her.
It's that nightdress.
It's just so hot.
Well, I guess we should probably just...
go back to being phone buddies again.
Why?
Because I like hanging out with you, too, and I think that if we continue to hang out, we will...
Mistakes will be made.
But I do want to say thank you so much for today, and not just for what you did for my mom and for me, which was amazing.
But you really gave me back a piece of myself.
You're the first person in a long time to show me that I exist outside of this house and away from this hospital bed and the frustration.
So thanks.
Well, then, you're very welcome.
Really.
And no matter what you're feeling right now...
... don't go have sex with some girl on Tinder.
You were thinking about it.
Mmm.
I'll call you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bye.
Good night.
Good night.
It is a beautiful day, Henrietta.
My love.
Call me Henrietta again, you're going over the balcony.
Okay, then. Bobby.
Oh, captain, my handsome captain.
What are you, high?
No, I'm not high.
I met a woman.
Two, actually.
I met a woman and her mother.
And I didn't have sex with either of them.
Ooh, why's it so cold in here?
I have told him a million times, wait for everything to be shut off before you hose down the place.
But does he listen? No.
He doesn't listen. You know what happens?
This. This is what happens.
Sir, can you hear me?
Um, yeah.
Does anything feel broken?
Uh, you want to maybe wait until I decide he's okay to be moved?
Be glad when Chimney gets back.
We'll all be glad for that.
Run it again!
Hey.
This is a good one. You got to see this.
All right, play the tape. Come on, one more time.
Wait for it. Wait for it.
Oh, crap.
No, no, no, no, no!
Buck, that man could have been seriously injured.
Help! Help! Help!
HEN: Listen, this is so...
: unprofessional.
HEN: I'm not laughing.
I'm not.
Yes!
Oh, okay.
I'm not laughing.
HEN: Oh, man.
I have never seen you laugh like that.
Well, I wasn't always like this.
So shut down.
What happened, Captain?
I made some mistakes, and I...
lost everything I cared about.
And I moved forward by never letting anybody get so important to me that I had to go through that kind of loss again.
But apparently I'm not very good at it, because you, Buck and Chimney have become that important to me.
Just let us in, Bobby.
I'll tell you what.
Let's get back to the house.
I'll cook you a delicious meal, and I'll introduce you to someone.
Who?
Me.
* Hey.
BUCK: Hey.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah, of course.
Did you want to have sex with me?
What?
Like, you might have made a mistake, too, right?
Um, yeah.
I mean...
yeah, definitely.
And, you know, you're...
