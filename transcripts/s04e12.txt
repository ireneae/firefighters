Yeah. They could be up near the headwaters, <em>but we can't see anything from here.</em>
You can't see the person?
<em>Then, what makes you think someone's trapped?</em>
We found a message in a bottle.
<strong>Pilot</strong>: <em>Dispatch, this is Fire Rescue One. We are on the scene.</em>
<strong>Maddie</strong>: <em>Copy that, Fire One.</em>
Engine and Rescue 118 are landing now.
<em>Rangers think the bottle may have come from the headwaters of the creek, south by southwest of your position, near the rocks.</em>
<strong>Pilot</strong>: <em>Copy that, dispatch.</em>

(<em>Sirens wailing</em>)
8,000 acres to search. We could be waiting awhile.
<strong>Buck</strong>: Are they sure someone's up there?
That bottle could have been floating around for months.
<strong>Hen</strong>: Which would mean our search and rescue might become a search and recovery.
Note was written on a receipt.
Rangers checked the date.
It was five days ago.
Sure hope it wasn't their last meal.
<strong>Pilot</strong>: <em>We see you, Captain Nash. We're coming in now.</em>
Copy that.
Okay, Chimney, Eddie, gear up. You're going with them.
Copy that. You'll harness up, we'll lower you down so you can grab him.
Cheer up. You can go next time.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: <em>Okay, first quadrant is right over that ridge. Head up to Devil's Point. A lot of hikers get stuck up there.</em>
<strong>Chimney</strong>: <em>Copy that, Cap.</em>

It could be where they threw the bottle in.

Drink this. It's got electrolytes.
How long have you been up here, Clyde?
Five days, maybe?
I'm not sure. (<em>Pained groaning</em>)
I was trying to get high enough to look around, and then I fell.
I thought I could tough it out, but I ran out of food and water.
Yup. Looks like you broke it.

No. No! No, I'm fine.

Oh, man.
Sir, let's get this on you.

Returning to base.
Careful! He's kind of delirious. Been out there awhile.

I'm fine. I just want to know when I can get back up there.
Definitely not today.
Do you have a cell phone?
Doesn't everyone?
<strong>Hen</strong>: Yes.
But most people use it to call for help instead of putting a message in a bottle.
Battery died yesterday.
That was two days after you injured yourself.
I didn't want to leave.
I was so close.
I didn't want anyone else to find the treasure.

<strong>Newsman</strong>: <em>This is Channel 8 with breaking news.</em>
<strong>Taylor</strong>: <em>Hollis Harcourt, the author of such cult classics as</em> Agony in Atwater <em>and</em> Bludgeoned in Burbank, <em>passed away in his sleep at age 57, leaving behind an intriguing message to his loyal fans.
Behold. My final gift to the citizens of Los Angeles... a rare and priceless treasure. Though, if I had to put a price on it for tax purposes, I'd call it about $5 million.</em>
Whoa. Five million.
<em>I'm gonna bury this chest somewhere in the city of Los Angeles. If you are clever, as I know you are, one of you will find this chest, and the treasure will be yours.</em>
<strong>Taylor</strong>: <em>We spoke with Harcourt's longtime assistant, Jeremiah Ruiz, moments ago. Hollis was... passionate. He had high standards. But he was a good soul. He cared about people and their stories. He will be missed.</em>
<strong>Taylor</strong>: <em>And he won't be forgotten. At least not any time soon. According to his final video, Hollis buried that $5 million treasure somewhere in the city that was the setting for most of his work. A poem he recited in the video is said to provide all the clues needed to locate it.</em>
<strong>Chimney</strong>: &quot;I walked along the river's edge, to hide my secret treasure.&quot;
This poem is terrible.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: &quot;A heron soared, a gray bridge roared, a bullfrog croaked 'Good measure.'&quot;
It's less of a poem, and more of a riddle.
Fine. It's a terrible riddle.
<strong>Hen</strong>: &quot;I stopped beneath a willow tree in the narrow place.
And then I saw the light beam fall upon my treasured place.&quot;
You know, the guy on the cliff... he asked me about willow trees.
A real-life treasure hunt.
Wouldn't it be... ?
Dangerous.
Reckless.
Stupid.
Probably not even real.
What if it is?
How cool would it be to find it?
You know, this poem-riddle thing is getting a lot of traffic.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Yeah, which means our friend Clyde is likely not the last emergency we're gonna see from this treasure hunt.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Your girlfriend's news story's probably not gonna help out with that.
She's my friend, not my girlfriend, and she's just doing her job.
Reporting the news.
Well, tell her to stop.
(<em>Alarm rings</em>)
We got enough work without people creating their own emergency.
Well, at least it was the midday news.
Maybe the whole thing dies off.
Before anyone actually dies.
I guess. (<em>Sighs</em>)
(<em>Phone ringing, vibrating</em>)
Uh, hey.
<em>I just saw you on the TV.</em>
And I heard a rumor you guys responded to a call about a treasure hunter in Malibu Creek?
<em>Yeah.</em>
He didn't find anything, though.
Not that there's anything to find.
<em>I mean, the whole thing's probably fake, right?</em>
I'm not so sure. Hollis's assistant confirmed he saw the treasure himself before Hollis died.
I didn't see that part on TV.
<em>He wanted to keep it off the record.</em>
In case this thing gets crazy, he doesn't want anyone to come looking for him.
<em>So this is real?</em>
There's $5 million out there just-just waiting to be found?
<em>Looks like it.</em>
You know, uh, I bet if we compared notes, we could probably figure out where he buried that treasure.
You're saying you want to team up?
<em>Look for the treasure together?</em>
We'd be, uh, we'd be doing a public service.
Hmm.
<em>We find it</em> so no one else has the chance to get hurt.
Yeah. And I mean, clearly, it's my duty to keep the city informed.
<em>The sooner that treasure is found,</em> the safer the city will be.
Everybody wins.
Maybe not everybody.
<em>My final gift to the citizens of Los Angeles...</em>
Nuts.
Please tell me that's not pοrn or sports.
<strong>Romero</strong>: This?
This is our future.
Apparently, a guy buried $5 million somewhere in the city, then told people to go out and find it.
<strong>Athena</strong>: I miss the days when bored rich people would just name wings of museums and hospitals after themselves.
(<em>Laughs</em>)
Have we had a conversation with this misguided citizen?
Yeah, that's a little hard to do.
He's been dead a week.
Did we post uniforms at his grave site?
You know, that's one of the first places people are gonna start digging.
Kevin, find out where he's buried.
Send some units. Thanks.

How bad do you think this is gonna get?
Ugh. City's coming out of a near yearlong lockdown.

<strong>Eddie</strong>: <em>You think it's weird that all the cases</em> are solo acts?
No teams.
Everybody's working alone.
I guess people are greedy, don't want to share the treasure.
Maybe that's the flaw in their plan.
Two brains are better than one.
What if we worked on it together, split the $5 million fifty-fifty?
Sorry, I, uh, already made a deal with Taylor.

How would you feel about 33-and-a-third?
Mm.
You need to give him 50% of your cut.
We're not splitting it three ways.
Do you really need the extra $400K that bad?
I already promised my cameraman I'd split my half with him.
So we split it four ways.
Okay? It's still more than a million each.

Well, if we were his research, we should all get paid.
(<em>Chuckles</em>)
He tell Athena where the treasure's at?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: No. If there even <em>is</em> a treasure.
Hollis never had to actually plant one to get what he wanted.
He just needed to say that he did.
And since we now officially know that he's a liar...
It's time to give up. Right?
No more treasure hunt.

<strong>Taylor</strong>: (<em>Sighs</em>) <em>I can't believe I fell for it.</em>
(<em>Chuckles softly</em>) I feel like an idiot.
Come on, we, uh, we all got fooled.
Yeah, but I should've known better.
Mm.
I'm a trained journalist.
(<em>Chuckles</em>)
Or, at least, I was.
Before I got caught up in this dumb treasure hunt.
(<em>Sighs</em>)
What was I thinking?
Think of it as a... a big adventure.
Uh...
But you got to sleep in your own bed every night.
<strong>Taylor</strong>: Huh.
We were so close.
Yeah, we were.
And then that selfish, lazy b*st*rd ruined everything.
Actually, that's not fair.
He wasn't completely lazy.
You know, he did like to jog.
But I can still hate him, right?
Right?

(<em>Sighs</em>)
Hey. (<em>Chuckles</em>)
You know, we could always rent a cabin now and then.
(<em>Chuckles</em>) For vacation.
Mm-hmm.
(<em>Chuckles</em>)
Do you even know how to fish?
I am from Minnesota.
Well, I take that as a yes.
Hmm.
&quot;I walked along the river's edge to hide my secret treasure. A heron soared, a gray bridge roared, a bullfrog croaked, 'Good measure.'&quot;
This is terrible.
No, it's awful.
(<em>Chuckles</em>)
He's not much of a poet. Or even a writer, I guess.
&quot;I stopped beneath a willow tree in the narrow place. And then I saw a light beam fall upon my treasured place.&quot;
The narrow place.
I was never able to figure that part out.
I searched his novels. Couldn't find a reference.
Not sure what I missed.
You're missing a book.
Yeah, Hollis's unpublished book.
<em>Gutted in Glendale.</em>
Hmm.
Hmm.
♪ ♪
Bobby?
Yeah.
I think I know where the treasure is.
<strong>Athena</strong>: The Glendale Narrows.
That's what they call this part of the river.
Wait. You mean this concrete channel with water in it?
I keep telling everybody, this is not a river.
Which is exactly why no one else ever thought of it.
All of you adventurers thinking you had to trek up into the mountains.
Never occurred to you to look right here in the city.
Home of herons.
And bullfrogs. And a gray bridge roaring.
Right there.
(<em>Chuckles</em>) Bit on the nose for a metaphor.
Well, Hollis isn't really a poet. Or a trustworthy person.
<strong>Hen</strong>: He's not the only one.
Uh, seriously?
Well, so much for giving up.
I cannot believe you guys.
We agreed we'd all stop looking.
And yet here we all are.
Did you two really bring your gear?
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Wasn't sure what the terrain would be like.
Wanted to be ready.
(<em>Scoffs</em>)
Hey.
They brought their med kits.
This treasure hunt has been nothing but medical rescues and injuries.
(<em>Chuckles</em>) I was not about to be one of them.
So, what tipped it off for you guys?
Hollis's yet-to-be-released novel, <em>Gutted in Glendale.</em>
And then the part in the poem about a narrow place.
Put it together...
Glendale Narrows.
It was the river for us.
Uh, Taylor said Hollis used to jog here.
My wife wrote an algorithm that detects changes in satellite images.
Okay, well, what do we do now?
Six of us, one treasure.
Technically, Bobby and I pulled up first.
Whoa.
<strong>Hen</strong>: Because you elected to keep the name of Hollis's unpublished novel to yourself.
I didn't know it was important.
(<em>Chuckles</em>)
Also, pretty sure this is the first time any of us are hearing about an algorithm.
Okay, guys, look, it's $5 million.
So we split it five ways.
Seven.
We have a preexisting deal with Taylor and her... cameraman.
(<em>Sighs</em>)
The cameraman with no name gets a cut?
No, no, no.
<strong>Hen</strong>: I really don't think that anyone who isn't physically here should get a cut.
(<em>Helicopter whirring overhead</em>)
<strong>Buck</strong>: Uh, sh-she already knew where we were going.
(<em>Scoffs</em>)
Okay, fine, look, we-we split it seven ways.
I don't know the exact math, but that's enough.
Uh, it's, uh, $714,285.
71.4 cents.
I don't know what to do with the point-four.
You-you can keep ours.
We found the treasure.
So let's go enjoy it. Together. Come on.
<strong>Athena</strong>: It's got to be buried on one of those little islands, the sandbars.
I see some willow trees.
But how will we know which one it is?
There's supposed to be a marker.
&quot;H&quot; marks the spot.
Or maybe we'll find someone else already there, beating us to it.
Is that Probie?
Guys!
I found it!
What's five million divided by eight?
I'm not doing any more math.
Ravi, why don't you do the honors since you were here first?
Pretty sure we would've been here first were it not for the extended round of negotiations.
<strong>Ravi</strong>: Wasn't as heavy as I thought.
I'm guessing it's just a check, not the actual jewels.
I mean, who would be dumb enough to do that? Right?

This is Taylor Kelly reporting from outside Hollis Harcourt's mansion, where, in a twist worthy of one of his novels, the famed author has been found dead.
Again.
So, you all found an empty treasure chest, drove down here like an angry mob to confront him, now he's dead.
But these facts are unrelated to each other?
Rick, he was dead when we got here.
We didn't kill him.
We just wanted to.
Buck.
You're new.
Yeah.
I'm not really with them.
Uh, I barely know these people, so...

Yeah.
We got the security footage.

She is.
Where have I seen her before?
My husband almost died! More people are gonna die!

I didn't kill him.
Yeah.
Been hearing that a lot tonight.
But you went there in disguise, under false pretenses.
Doesn't look good.
He was a horrible person.
But you didn't kill him?
You're not really delivering anything.
Where did you get the outfit?
From my husband.
My sweet, kind, normally level-headed husband.
(<em>Exhales</em>)
Who almost lost his life because of your ridiculous treasure hunt.
If you're surprised that your husband is a greedy, reckless man, then maybe the truth is you didn't know him as well as you thought.
So... you're welcome.
(<em>Scoffs</em>) He's not greedy.
He wanted the money for his family.
We have a baby on the way, and now he can't work.
He might not be able to do his job ever again thanks to you.
And?
You need to fix this. Make it right.
Oh, oh, I see. Okay, this is a-a shakedown.
Got it. Um, who should I make the check out to?

She's not wrong.
She didn't technically kill him.
The M.E. talked to his doctors.
He had a heart condition.
Hollis let her into the house.
So, no breaking and entering charges.
She just let him die.
And the DA isn't gonna want to touch this with a ten-foot pole.
Everyone just wants this whole thing to go away.
I know I do.
(<em>Honking in distance</em>)
But what do you think happened to the money?
Buck, there was no money.
Hollis was just yanking everyone's chain.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: The whole city.

No. He was just as surprised as I was that Hollis was alive.

Hollis didn't bury an empty chest.
Hollis didn't bury anything.
