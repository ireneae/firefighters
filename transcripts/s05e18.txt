* Welcome-mm-mm-mm...
to the beginning.
As the snake sheds its skin, the butterfly emerges from the cocoon, here at the Anant Ka Aashram, so, too, will you be reborn and emerge fresh from this spiritual journey.
Let us begin our therapeutic session by drinking the ceremonial tea of renewal and rebirth.
KATHY: You said "rebirth." There's not placenta or anything in this, is there?
Wait, that's not a thing, is it?
Oh, a lady from my walking group used to blend her placenta in a smoothie.
Okay, but that's not in the tea, right?
Of course not.
Um, so what is?
Ah, it's an ancient mystic's recipe.
Yeah, that's not an answer.
Um, black, green, chai, oolong teas mixed with matcha, dried mushroom caps, ginger and...
I'm-I'm sorry, did you just say mushrooms?
As in hallucinogenic narcotics?
Is that bad? This is California.
It's a felony!
Is it?
REGGIE: Yeah.
You just roofied us.
Okay.
* I like to dream * Hey!
* Yes, yes * * Right between the sound machine... * (group shouting angrily) KATHY: He's getting away.
Ah, okay, should've gone to real estate school.
Oh, boy.
Okay. Get in there.
We almost got him.
* Well, you don't know what we can find... * Siri... call 911.
Siri, call 911.
Oh, Buddha.
(screams) (siren wailing) Can someone tell me what happened?
We unleashed our primal selves. (chortles) These people appear to be hallucinating.
MAN: Hi.
How would you know?
You looked like this when you were dosed.
No, I didn't.
(scoffs) Whatever.
He dosed us, man, and then dude went over.
Over where?
Uh...
Ortiz, make sure they stay away from the edge.
(exhales) HEN: Sir!
Are you hurt?
(Eugene shuddering) I, uh, I think I sprained my ankle on the way down.
We're gonna come down and get you.
Oh, thank God.
Okay, everybody, ladder rescue. Hen, Chim, prep a basket.
Buck, Ravi, start extending that ladder over the edge of the cliff.
Uh, Cap, I-I was gonna harness up.
I'm gonna go down to get him. Donato, you're with me.
Yeah, copy that, Cap.
You riding the ropes, Cap?
What, did I stutter? Let's move!
(brakes squeak) Go.
BOBBY: You set?
Set.
All right, let's go.
All right, Eugene, you hang tight. We're almost there.
Oh, thank God. Whoa.
All right, Ravi, basket's ready as soon as Cap is.
(rumbling) Wait, did you feel that? Was that a quake?
Guys, what the hell was that?
The cliff's going.
That didn't feel right, Cap.
Cap, Lucy, unhook now. The cliff's coming down, and it's taking the ladder with it.
CHIMNEY: Everybody fall back!
BOBBY: All right, Lucy, unhook.
Get down!
Cap!
(exhales) That-That-That's bad, right?
Yeah, Eugene.
That's bad.
NEWSMAN: Quite the predicament for these first responders.
Turns out they needed some second responders.
Must we keep reliving this?
It's on every channel.
Then shut it off.
... LAFD paramedic Jonah Greenway.
Our Taylor Kelly has a fresh report on that coming up next.
BOBBY: This wasn't a punishment, Buck.
Come on, Cap.
I-I know everyone is mad about Taylor's story.
No one is mad.
Chief Alonzo seemed pretty mad when he was interrogating me.
This was a hearing about Jonah, Buck. Not an interrogation.
No, the interrogation came after the hearing in his office.
He wanted to know all these things about Taylor.
You know, wh-where does she get her information?
Who are her sources?
Am I one of them?
They were embarrassed.
It would have been better for the department if they could have released this story themselves, controlled the narrative a little bit.
I think they would have liked a heads-up. That's all.
Yeah, well, they aren't the only ones.
She promised me, Cap.
She promised me she wouldn't do the story, and I believed her.
I'm sorry I let you down.
This wasn't your fault, Buck.
You know, I can't even blame Taylor for all this.
She's a reporter.
She wasn't the one running around, playing God right under my nose.
Cap, you couldn't have known.
I should have!
It's my job.
Sorry, kid.
EDDIE: He said that?
He did.
Well, you know how he is.
He takes responsibility for everything.
That's his way.
Probably why he makes such a good captain.
Taking responsibility for something he didn't do wrong?
(inhales) It's a bad road to go down.
You lose sight of things, of who you are.
I just... I-I wish I could...
Fix it? (chuckles) Yeah, yeah, I know.
I'm the guy that always wants to fix everything.
Hey, comes in handy when you have a bunch of holes in your wall.
Also sounded like maybe you needed a reason to get out of the house.
Uh, yeah.
Taylor and I are still avoiding each other.
Mm.
I-I know we-we have to talk.
I still feel so angry.
Feel like whatever I say is just gonna be mean.
You can't put it off forever.
You keep that anger and resentment bottled up?
Eventually you snap.
(Bobby grunts) (sighs) Mom? Bobby?
(grunts) Damn it.
Yeah?
(exhales) Hey.
Oh, no, what happened?
Uh, I was just cleaning up before dinner, and I somehow managed to break a glass.
Are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah, it's just a scratch.
Uh, I tell you what, let me just clean this up, and...
Oh, no.
I got it. You clean that cut and maybe change your shirt.
Oh, yeah.
That's probably not the most appetizing thing for your celebration dinner.
What do you mean, "celebration"?
Mom and Harry are about to walk through that door with a congratulatory "you're going to college" balloon arrangement, aren't they?
There might be some USC sweatshirts involved, as well.
Okay.
Tell you what, I'm gonna go change before they get back.
Yeah. So much for my surprise announcement.
(whispers): Oh, my gosh.
(glass crunches) You were right. Fish tacos here are pretty damn good.
Though still probably not as good as Andrea's.
Andrea's.
(Chimney chuckles softly) So, I, I just wanted us to talk through some stuff without our tiny human interrupting.
(music playing faintly) I'm okay with it.
If you feel you're ready, then I support you completely.
Really?
Yeah.
I know it didn't work out with us, but...
I still want you to be happy, so if you think it's time...
What do you think that I think we're ready for?
Dating. Other people.
Going back to work.
That's what I was gonna talk to you about.
Oh, so not dating?
Well, I mean, if you're ready to start dating...
No. No, I'm not... No. I mean, I'm-I'm-I'm...
(chuckles): Can we start this conversation over, please?
(chuckles) Okay. I would like to go back to work.
At the call center. And I know that it's gonna complicate the schedule that we've already worked out, and we'll take a hit financially with day care, but...
You miss helping people.
I guess I didn't realize how much that place really mattered to me until I saw it burning on television.
I never should have walked away.
They'd be glad just to have you back.
(door opens) CHIMNEY: Hey.
Lunch clearly went well.
You're in a much better mood than when you left.
I'm guessing the talk with Maddie was good.
(exhales) She wasn't asking for permission to date anyone.
You were wrong about that one, little brother.
That is not how I remember the conversation going.
You were the one who was spiraling.
I believe I told you to chill.
I do not spiral.
Yeah, well, maybe you would if you took one of these.
What is...
Career aptitude test.
ALBERT: Now that I've quit the fire department, I'm gonna have to start over.
Won't be following in your footsteps.
Definitely won't be following in Father's, so...
(chuckles) Guess I have to find other footsteps.
CHIMNEY: Wow. Archaeologist.
Librarian. Sociologist.
Trial lawyer?
You don't think I'd make a good lawyer?
I don't know. I don't see it.
(chuckles) There you go. That's you.
What?
Cosmetologist.
(music playing faintly) DEENA: Dontrell.
Deena. Hey. What brings you in?
Without an appointment.
Something's wrong. Ever since you put in these extensions last week, I've had these headaches.
Oh, I warned you that might happen.
It's gonna be a little tight at first, but it'll slowly loosen up. Just give it some time, okay?
This isn't tight. It's crippling pain.
Hey, being pretty ain't pretty.
DEENA: I want you to take them out now.
Start over and do it right this time.
Deena, don't you think you're being a little overdramatic?
I have a one-star review, and I'm not afraid to use it.
Raquel, sweetie, why don't you give us a minute?
Why don't you try a espresso from over there?
Okay.
Have a seat.
(Deena sighs) It hurts the most in the back, right in the crown.
This isn't cool, Deena.
I'm not a fan of doing my work twice.
You should have done it right the first time.
Oh, my God.
DEENA: What?
Oh, my gosh.
HEN: BP's a little low, but his heart sounds good.
Pupils are equal and reactive, so we can rule out any sort of TBI or hematoma.
(Dontrell whimpers) CHIMNEY: Easy.
You got a pretty nasty bump on your head. You're gonna...
His head?!
What about mine?
Ma'am, I'm afraid your stylist is out of commission for the day. You're gonna have to find somebody else to deal with your hair emergency.
Then you have to help me, okay? My head, it's throbbing.
Ever since he put these extensions in a few days ago, I've had these blinding headaches.
You keep scissors in that thing, right? Can you cut it out?
HEN: Uh...
BOBBY: Uh, Hen, can you come and take a look at this?
DEENA: What?
Uh, just-just hold still.
Okay.
Uh...
Hen, aren't those...?
HEN: Whoa.
Maggots.
(screams) You did this to me!
(gasping) Ma'am, I need you to calm down.
What's your name?
Deena.
HEN: Okay, Deena, have a seat.
Okay? I'm Hen.
Okay? I can't help you unless you calm down. Take a deep breath.
(gasping) Calm down. Everything's gonna be fine.
All right. You might need these. Here.
HEN: Yeah.
Hold the light while I try to cut one of these out.
Ugh.
(Deena whimpers) HEN: Yep. Live larva.
(Deena groans) It's mostly superficial.
No sign of systemic parasitic infection.
Ugh.
But it's definitely an infestation.
Oh, God, I think I'm gonna be sick.
HEN: You're gonna be okay, all right?
We're gonna get you to the hospital, and they're gonna take good care of you.
BOBBY: Okay, let's clean her up as best we can, get-get her ready for transport.
We should try to get 'em out now.
Otherwise, they're gonna remove them surgically, shave her head.
Shave my head? I can't walk around with a shaved head.
(gasping) I don't have your bone structure.
I could never pull it off.
Do you mind telling me how the hell this could happen?
I-I have no idea.
Well, you had to get the hair from somewhere, right?
Well, yeah.
I-I-I-I mean, I-I had to...
And?
You don't understand.
Like, it's so hard finding real human hair right now.
Everything's back-ordered. The supply chain's all messed up.
I was gonna lose clients.
Where did you get the hair?
(siren wails) Can I help you, Officer?
You're Gregory Abewell of Abewell Mortuary?
Yes.
I-Is there a problem?
We need to have a talk, Mr. Abewell.
About what?
(sighs) HEN: I'd heard about folks illegally harvesting tissue and bones from dead people, but hair?
Hmm. That's why I stick to au naturel.
(chuckles softly) Half the time, you don't know what people trying to sell you.
CLIVE: And I am more than fine with the authentic Antonia.
That poor woman must have spent hundreds of dollars to get her hair done only to end up in the hospital.
Not to mention a lifetime of nightmares.
Do they lay eggs or something in your head?
Uh...
Wait, could they burrow into your brain?
Okay, I think we need a new topic of conversation.
(chuckles) Well, Clive and I have some news.
I have asked your mother to do me the honor of becoming my wife.
And I said yes.
Ma! That's amazing.
We are so happy for you two.
DENNY: Congratulations, Grammy.
Do I get to call you Grandpa now?
You can call me whatever you like.
(chuckles) HEN: I-I can't believe you're gonna make it official.
I kind of thought that you had given up on that entire institution.
TONI: Well, it turns out not all marriages are fiery hellscapes.
(Karen chuckles) Yours seems to be doing okay.
HEN: So, what are you thinking?
Family trip to Vegas could be fun.
Actually, we were hoping to do it here.
Maybe in the backyard?
O-Our backyard?
TONI: Yeah.
Make it a real wedding, especially since it's Clive's first time.
CLIVE: First and last.
Mwah.
TONI: So, you guys okay with that?
Ma, I think it would...
(silverware clangs) (chair scoots) What was that?
She didn't come to our wedding, Hen. The one we had right here in the same backyard she wants to get married in.
She apologized. We forgave her.
(Karen sighs) Didn't we?
I-I love Toni. I do.
And having her here has changed our family in the best way, but...
Oh, the thought of, of her getting married here just...
Karen, I can't believe you're still bothered by this.
Yes, my mother didn't come to our wedding.
But I've found a way to let it go.
It was still a beautiful day.
You didn't see the look on your face.
You met me at the altar and turned to see if she was there.
And there was an empty chair.
And I watched your heart break before we even said "I do." It wasn't the happiest day of our life, Hen.
But it was still a pretty damn good one.
Hmm?
Yeah. It was. (chuckles) Listen, if you don't want them to get married here, it's okay.
But I need you to talk to her.
I don't want this to become a thing.
I'll fix it.
(crying): I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
Of course you can have your wedding here.
MADDIE: (sighs) This is... interesting.
Everybody hates it.
(chuckles) It was supposed to be some new communal workspace.
Opened right before the pandemic and closed two months later.
Well, at least you have buzzword salad on the walls.
(Josh sighs) It's just temporary until the new space is ready for us.
And when's that gonna be?
Mid-September, I think?
Welcome back, Maddie.
There's doughnuts in the breakroom.
Oh, I'm good, but it's nice to see you.
Sir, I understand your car being towed feels like an emergency...
We're sharing the breakroom with the accounting firm next door.
The good news is, they always have doughnuts.
Bad news is...
They always have doughnuts.
Maddie, welcome back.
(both chuckle) MAY: Sir, I could just send the police.
That's what I thought. Have a great day.
(Maddie exhales) You got this.
Do I? Because I thought I was coming back to work, and now it feels like I'm starting over.
JOSH: The space may have changed.
The job hasn't. You're gonna be great.
Okay.
(sighs) (beeps) 911.
What's your emergency?
(phone chimes) Ah! Maddie took her first call.
No one died.
RAVI: That's great news.
Both parts.
What?
No, nothing.
(phone vibrates) Oh, hey. I just got a text from my sister about her first call.
I guess we can all see Chimney still comes first.
You know, this is a sign. I-I really think...
Oh, is this the part of our day where we share our opinions about each other's relationships?
(chuckles) 'Cause I have a few choice words about your...
BUCK: Okay, okay.
Hey, Cap. I heard that May's leaving the call center for college?
BOBBY: Yeah.
Wow. You and your wife must be really happy about that.
Well, relieved more than anything.
I-I think it'll be good for her to get away from the emergencies, the tragedies.
I just want to say one...
Hey, is, uh, May gonna do anything over the summer?
Uh, she didn't get to do that when she graduated, right?
BOBBY: Well, she's going to Miami with her brother Harry.
And then she's gonna go visit Athena's parents.
They're gonna have a few weeks together before school starts.
Oh. She's gonna miss the wedding.
Mom doesn't have a lot of friends left in the area.
I think Karen was hoping to draft some people to fill in that side of the aisle.
How did Karen go from hard no to planning the wedding?
Overcompensating for massive amounts of guilt.
(chuckles) I think it's sweet that Karen was defending you.
I mean, isn't that what we all want in a partner?
Knowing that they have your back?
Yeah. Until they stick a knife in it.
You really need to talk to her.
I think maybe I'm just gonna hope it works itself out.
Just do us all a favor. Stay away from the tequila until you've made a rational decision about that situation.
CHIMNEY: Yeah.
We like Lucy. So next time you go kissing on her again, you're the one who has to leave.
(mouths) When did you two kiss?
Two months ago.
I feel like I am missing warning signs left and right.
Bobby, there are some things that subordinates do not tell captains.
Or sergeants.
I still should have known.
But the fact that you haven't noticed means that it hasn't been a problem, right?
I guess.
(scoffs softly) But you're in your own head about it.
Like everything else.
You know, I'm kind of jealous of May and Harry.
When was the last time we had a vacation?
What, just us together?
Exactly.
And we have had a year.
What would you say to us taking the honeymoon that we never had?
I feel like there's so much happening right now. I don't...
I just need some time to think about it.
Cole, it's time.
Yeah, okay, baby.
Baby. Hospital. Now.
Baby. Come on. Let's go.
Baby.
Okay. Okay. All right.
Let's... (groaning) COLE: All right, all right. Okay.
AMARI: Okay.
COLE: We got this. We got this.
AMARI: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(groans, exhales) Okay. Okay.
All right.
Shoes.
Shoes. Shoes. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Shoes. Yes, yes.
Okay. Okay, okay.
We're good. We're good.
Okay.
We got it. Get that foot in there.
We're good. Let's just...
Doing amazing. We're doing amazing.
Yes. Got it. Okay.
(exhales) Okay.
All right, let me grab the bag.
(Amari breathing deeply) All right, charger. Okay.
(Amari groans) Okay, okay, okay, okay. So, I got laptop. Charger.
Yes.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Toothpaste.
Baby bag.
Yeah.
Think I remembered everything.
Yes.
You always do. Let's go.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Okay.
You doing okay?
Good? All right.
All good.
Okay.
Okay.
(grunts, exhales) Okay. Yeah.
(both exhale) All right.
(engine starts) (Amari gasps) MADDIE: Hello?
Are you there?
Hello?
Is anyone there? Are you okay?
Um, there's been an accident.
Are you injured?
COLE: I don't... I think...
I think s-something bad happened.
I need you to stay on the line with me, sir.
I'm here.
Okay.
(typing) Help is on the way.
(siren wailing) Buck, Lucy, saws and Jaws.
MADDIE: 118, be advised, driver is semiconscious.
We've lost contact.
Dispatch, I've also got a passenger.
A pregnant woman.
Copy that. Driver did not report it.
Sending additional ambulance.
BOBBY: Okay, Hen, you check on Mom.
Chimney, you've got Dad.
Cap, I-I need a way in.
All right, right here.
(grunts) How you doing in here?
Cole.
CHIMNEY: Cap, he's wedged in there pretty tight.
It's gonna take some time to get him out.
HEN: I can't get her out without getting him out, and I need to get her out now.
How many weeks are you?
AMARI: Um, 38.
We were on our way to...
Were you in labor before the accident?
(Amari panting) CHIMNEY: Hey, Cole.
You've been in an accident. You took quite a hit.
Let me just check your vitals.
Cap, one pupil is less reactive. We got to get him out of here.
Copy that.
How's Mom and baby?
(grunts) Angle's bad.
I can't get a heartbeat.
Oh, God.
It doesn't mean there isn't one.
BOBBY: Okay, everybody, clear the vehicle. Let's cut 'em out.
(whirring) (siren wailing) Is the baby okay?
Please tell me he's okay.
No other pain besides the contractions?
No.
So, we're doing this again?
How come we're doing it again?
CHIMNEY: Uh, I just wanted an update.
Hey, Cap, can you call ahead and set up a TBI protocol?
What does that mean?
Water was clear. No meconium.
From what I can tell, you're eight centimeters and almost fully effaced.
Can you tell me your name again, sir?
So, we're doing that again, too?
It's Cole.
CHIMNEY: That's right.
Now, can you tell me what year it is, Cole?
COLE: Course I can.
It's two thousand...
Uh, two thousand...
Sorry.
There it is.
(exhales) The heartbeat is strong.
You're gonna have this baby soon, Amari.
But not in this ambulance.
What about Cole?
CHIMNEY: Can you tell me who the president is?
COLE: President?
It's...
It's that old guy. Um...
It's okay.
You're just foggy from the head trauma.
We need to keep you alert and awake.
Believe me, having your first child will definitely do that for you.
I'm having a kid?
Is he all right?
We're bringing your husband in for further observation.
Oh, Cole! Cole.
I called my sister. She's on the way.
She's gonna record everything so you don't have to miss it.
Miss what?
Cole?
Do I know you?
I don't... I don't know her. Do I know her?
(Amari panting) Okay.
Try to relax.
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be all right.
* Said my name * * So quietly... * So, how much time do you think he lost?
At least six or seven years.
Hen said with this type of amnesia, there's a-a chance his memories might come back.
Or there'll just be a big black hole in the middle of his life.
You remember that movie?
The woman, she-she wakes up every morning, and her brain resets to a year ago, so anything she does today, she won't remember tomorrow.
Yeah, that was anterograde amnesia.
Works a little differently.
It still sounds like a nightmare.
You know, starting over every day.
Always doing the same thing, making the same mistakes.
Never having a chance to learn or make a different decision.
Like a hamster on a wheel.
It was a comedy.
I think it's supposed to be romantic.
You know, the idea that the guy would work hard every day, making her fall in love with him over and over again.
So every day is the best day ever.
Is that really love?
Right? Sh-Shouldn't it be when you're at your worst, they're at their worst, you have every reason to give up, and you still decide you want to try again?
I guess it is.
* After all. * (monitor beeping steadily) COLE: So, the baby's okay?
Eight pounds, one ounce.
They wouldn't let me bring him.
(exhales) (crying): I'm sorry.
I wish...
Hey. Hey.
It's all right.
It's not.
I had this whole life, and I don't remember it.
I don't remember you or our son.
And what if I never remember?
What if...
Then we start over.
How?
I'm gonna tell you a story.
What kind of story?
A love story.
("If I Could Build My Whole World Around You" playing) (metal clinks) (knock on door) * Oh, if I could build my whole world... * Hi.
Hello.
Did you order roti, sticky rice, grilled pork, and coconut soup?
I know, it's a lot. (chuckles) (chuckles) Wait, are you the delivery guy?
I'm your neighbor.
Uh, delivery guy left it on my doorstep and ran.
I guess he was late for the next one.
Oh.
Sorry about that. (chuckles) Um, thank you for carrying it the last few yards.
I'm Cole, by the way. Welcome to the neighborhood.
Amari. Uh...
(chuckles) Yeah.
(chuckles) Oh, let me get that.
Delivery guy and a doorman.
(chuckles) So, are you, uh, new to the area?
An opportunity came up, so...
You know what they say.
Opportunity never knocks twice.
* Rest of your life * * Oh, and happiness would surely... * You hungry?
I could eat.
* Oh, yes, it would * * Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo * * Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo * * Doo, doo, doo, doo * (dialogue inaudible) * Oh, if I could build my whole world around you * * I'd give you the greatest gift any woman could possess * * And I'd step into this world you've created * * And give you true love and tenderness * * And there'd be something new with every tomorrow * * To make this world better as days go by * * That is if I could build my whole world around you * * If I could build my whole world around you * * And that would be all right * * Oh, yeah * * If I could build my whole world around you * * If I could build my whole world around ya * * And that would be all right * * Oh, yeah * * If I could just... * Yes!
* If I could build my whole world around you * * And that would be all right, oh, yeah * * If I could build my whole world around you * * If I could build... * Good?
All good.
(Amari exhales) * And that would be all right * * Oh, yeah * * If I could just * * Build my world, baby * * If I could build it, build it * * All around you * * And that would be all right. * Buck?
You home?
(exhales) Well, I guess we've moved past the avoidance stage?
BUCK: I think we can both admit it was starting to get ridiculous.
I'm sorry you're still upset about the story.
You're not sorry for what you did, though.
The story was gonna come out regardless.
If I hadn't have broken it, someone else would have.
Y-You couldn't have called me first?
No, you-you just...
You figured I'd be fine. I'd get over it.
Buck, I wasn't trying to hurt you or anyone else.
I was just trying to get the truth out there.
A truth the public has every right to know.
This is literally our first argument all over again.
Which is why we shouldn't be having it.
You knew who I was when we started dating.
I guess I thought I could learn to live with it.
I don't want to be something you have to learn to live with.
And I don't want to keep on making the same mistakes. (sniffles) I need things to be different, Taylor.
Okay.
I'm willing to try that.
Clean slate.
Yeah.
Just not together.
EDDIE: May, you got a sec?
Hey. I heard you hit a million followers.
Oh, yeah.
That's what happens when a ladder truck goes off a cliff.
Two days of tweets about traffic collisions and trash fires should take care of that.
Yeah.
What do you need?
How's Bobby doing?
Why would you ask me that?
Probably the same reason you're looking at me like that.
The other night, I went to the house to tell them that I'd decided on going back to college, but when I got there, it was weird.
He had just dropped a glass and cut his hand.
Why was that weird?
Because the way he acted when I came in.
Felt like I was interrupting more than just a broken glass.
ATHENA: Hey, babe. What's up?
I just went out to pick up some basics we were running low on.
How's your shift?
Mm, nothing much, but I'm just getting started.
How are you doing?
I'm good. Gonna have an early dinner and call it a night.
All right.
Good to hear.
(knock on door) Uh, somebody's at the door, so-so I got to run.
All right.
See you in the morning.
Okay. Love you. Bye.
Eddie.
Bobby.
Promise I don't have any transfer requests in my hand.
(chuckles) All right, then you can come in.
All right.
(door closes) Can't stay for long.
I need to pick up Christopher.
But, um...
I wanted to say...
Jonah wasn't your fault.
Eddie.
No, look, I spent the last few months trying to put away a lot of things from the past and move on.
What I've learned is, you can't carry someone else's weight.
It'll take you under.
I'm the captain.
My responsibility...
Is your team.
But he was on the 118 for, what, a-a few weeks?
You barely knew him.
You think you missed something?
All the other cities, other houses.
Everybody missed something.
This happened on my watch.
He killed Claudette and who knows how many others.
Because he thought he was a god.
But he's not.
Neither are you.
You're not all-knowing and all-seeing, Bobby.
You're just a good man.
I'm not.
I am not.
You saved my life.
And my son's.
So, whatever responsibility you take for Jonah, you make sure you take some credit for me.
You earned it.
(sighs) I got to go.
Hey, are you sure you can't stay for dinner?
Oh, man, I'd love to, but Christopher got some friends over, and-and I don't want to leave Carla without backup.
Yeah, I got you.
Yeah.
Thanks for stopping by, Eddie.
I mean it.
Literally the least I could do, Bobby.
Thank you.
(door opens) (door closes) * * * (groans) Did you order enough linens for this one, too?
I ordered exactly what you told me to.
Thought you could use a hand.
Or a few hands.
What are you doing here?
Did you...?
No. No.
BUCK: Come on, Hen.
You know we weren't gonna miss this.
Miss what?
You should ask your mom.
Hi, Karen.
Go get a drink.
KAREN: Hey.
EDDIE: Yeah.
You're not getting married, Ma?
Clive and I can do it another time.
I have four dozen deviled eggs in the fridge.
There will be a wedding today.
TONI: There will.
Just not mine.
Ma...
TONI: Henrietta, let me say this.
I'm sorry I didn't come to your wedding.
I had my reasons, my excuses.
I didn't understand.
I wasn't ready.
I needed more time to catch up with the way the world was changing.
But the truth is, honey, I was just wrong.
It's okay, Toni.
TONI: No, it isn't.
I don't know how you found it in your heart to forgive me, but I'm grateful you did.
We all lost something that day.
I think today may be our chance to get it back.

So, are you, uh, headed home to eat, or...
I was going to.
But it does look like a nice place to stay for a while.
You wanna...?
Sure.
(laughs) * And I went to see the doctor of philosophy... * Hey, remember, I've got that appointment today, so Carla's gonna pick you up after school.
Okay?
Okay.
(sighs) Remember, talking about it makes it less scary.
