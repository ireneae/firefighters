PINO: Medically induced.
It was significant, and we want to give the brain time to heal on its own.
BOBBY: How long will he be sedated?
PINO: At least 24 hours.
Run more tests, then see where we are tomorrow.
And then we can take him home?
PINO: Mrs. Carter, your husband suffered an ischemic stroke.
It's not only serious, but the prognosis is uncertain.
Samuel's very strong.
I have no doubt, but we don't know how he will or will not respond to the treatment.
We have to be prepared.
Do not t-take that tone with me, young man.
BOBBY: I think what Dr. Pino is saying is that right now we just need to be patient, that's all.
That's correct.
I have to run these tests. He won't even be in the room.
ATHENA: It's okay, Daddy, I'm here.

It looks fine.
The ground is softer here.
Maybe you're watering too much.

This is Captain 118. We're gonna need a black-and-white at our current location.
Our backyard accident seems to be an attempted murder. We've apprehended a suspect.
How can you--? How are you allowed to do this?
All LAFD personnel are sworn peace officers.
It's been that way for about 100 years?
See?
You've learned two things today.
Mama, the car's still in the house.
Your father will deal with it when he gets home.
Mama, you do realize that Daddy is not coming home for a while.
Don't be ridiculous.
He'll be fine.
I'll go get your room ready.
Would you rather we stay in a hotel?
Maybe you should.
Mama!
Well, nobody asked you to invade my home.
I haven't pulled that trundle bed out in years.
Maybe your big, strong fireman can do it.
Mama, I swear...
It-It's okay.
It's okay. Beatrice, we'll set ourselves up.
I do not know what is in her head.
Well, her world did just crash down around her.
Well, this does look worse than I thought.
But I can get the car out of there, board up the windows. We will need to contact a contractor...
That we have.
Old family friend.
I think he's still their handyman.
You think you can get this car out of here by yourself?
Big, strong fireman.
What are you reading, Buck?
Oh, it's, uh, it's Bobby's.
Oh, are you trying to tell us something?
Um, no, he just, he told me about this idea in AA. I took it upon myself to, you know, dig a little deeper.
Hey, can... can I ask you something?
Sure.
Are you at ease?
Do I look like I'm at ease, Buck?
No, sorry, wrong question. It's just in-in the book, it says that if I'm at ease, "all my fear will fall away from me." Well, let me know how that works out.
Yes, sir, I hear the sirens, too.
You're welcome.
What did we say about lurking, Noah?
Sorry.
I just wanted to thank you.
For saving me, you know, when I crashed and burned.
You didn't do either of those things.
Today you learned how the element of surprise can refocus a caller's attention.
And if that doesn't work?
Try singing to them.
There was this guy who went off Mulholland into the ravine.
And I had to sing a few bars of the Thompson Twins' "Hold Me Now." It was playing on his radio, and by hearing me sing it...
It got him to pay attention.
I wish I could listen to more calls.
Didn't they give you samples at the academy?
I already listened to all of them. Also I'm pretty sure they were as old as the Thompson Twins.
Okay, uh...
If you want some more recent calls, just check out the active logs.
Put in your ID number and...
All the calls I could ever want.
Awesome.
I promise I won't play the one of you singing.
No, no, go ahead. I nailed it.
Chamomile delivery.
(chuckles) Chimney, you're a godsend.
Hey, uh...
don't you have finals this week?
I thought you'd be hitting the books.
Ah, later.
You would not believe how much extra paperwork arresting a guy generates.
(laughs) I got to get through all of this so that I can make a 10:00 review class.
Did you just bring me some tea or you were waiting for me to spill some tea?
(laughs) Uh...
the aforementioned finals, they decide if you get into your third year, right?
That is correct.
So why did you agree to become captain?
If you knew all of this was coming down the pike.
Trust me.
I-I got this.

Can you both feel your legs?
More than I'd like.
Where the hell is Lev?
Is he okay? Lev!
Kind of in the middle of something.
(Angelo groans) I guess under the middle of something.
Vitals holding. Let's run two lines on him, wide open.

Not necessarily.

Oh, do not say it.

Seems like you guys have known each other for a while.
Ever since sixth grade.
That's nice.

All right. But it is gonna hurt.

One, two, three.

Yeah. They're in great hands, and you're next.
Okay. Those two...

Why a happiness convention, huh?

You live your whole life, doing everything you're supposed to.
Marriage, kids.
Big house, nice cars.

Yeah!
We're coming to get you.

Normally we travel you with a foreign object, but in this case, the object is your friend.
So what do we do?
Pull you apart very carefully.
Dispatch, the victim's showing signs of a punctured lung.
We've already got two complicated rescues in progress.
133 is already en route.
The 133 will be there in 12 minutes.
I just, I don't have enough hands to get them both out right now, and I need the hydraulic jack for the kid.
Most likely, Lev has already bled out internally, and that slab of concrete's acting as a clamp, keeping him alive.
We lift it, most likely he dies anyway.
Kid's got a better shot.
Hey, Lev...
Hey.
You ready to get this thing off of me?
There's a kid buried over there.
I think he's got a punctured lung.
I-I need to get him out of there.
And you don't have enough guys.
You get that kid out.
I ain't going nowhere.
Go help the kid.
Buck.
Help me with this.

Where the bonfires happened when we all hung out in high school.
When I was a little girl, Daddy and I would go out there every Saturday morning, grab oranges and tangerines that had fallen from the trees.
Bring 'em home, make fresh juice, pour it over ice and sit, right here. (chuckles) I would sit on his lap.
He would tell me stories about the family, about all the great things that the Carters had done.
Daddy was an attorney, but his daddy had been one, too.
First Negro lawyer to pass the Florida bar.
Even graduated from A&M just like him.
And that's what made you want to be a lawyer.
Oh, it did.
And when I left for California, oh, he couldn't have been prouder.
Told me to spread my wings, do great things.
And what did Beatrice say?
"Do not drink that juice, it has not been pasteurized." (Bobby chuckles) Daddy was always the comfort.
Mama was the reality.
I'm not sure I'm ready to lose the comfort.

this great mystery, and then he died before he could share it.

<i> ATHENA:</i> <i> Did I ever tell you about</i> <i> when I decided to become</i> <i> an officer of the law?</i> I was nine years old.
Middle of the night, <i> I wake up and I see</i> <i> my father getting dressed.</i> <i> Grabbing a flashlight.</i> <i> His gun.</i> <i>I look out the window and I see</i> <i> the whole neighborhood</i> <i> out there.</i> <i> A little girl, she was</i> <i> a-a grade behind me at school,</i> <i> had gone missing.</i> <i> Someone had just snatched her</i> <i> right out of her bed.</i> <i> HEN: Wow, that's a nightmare.</i> <i> Did they find her?</i> <i> ATHENA: They found a barrette,</i> <i> out of her hair.</i> <i> Out in the woods.</i> <i> But that was it.</i> <i> She was just gone.</i> <i> I promised myself</i> <i> that when I was old enough</i> <i> I was gonna become</i> <i> a policewoman</i> <i> and find that little girl...</i> Tanya Kingston.
