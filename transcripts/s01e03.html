JOSH: Compensate much?
Ah, he only turns ten once.
And what ten-year-old doesn't want a sushi chef at his birthday party?
Cam!
Eh, maybe I'm overcompensating a little bit.
He's dealing with a lot lately.
Man, this wind is awful, huh?
JOSH: Santa Anas.
Makes my allergies go crazy.
Cam! You having fun?
His mother's turning him against me. Undermining.
I told you to give her more in the divorce settlement.
That money pays her to be cool.
This wind. Dan, do you mind holding your son?
Excuse me.
Danny!
Coming in!
Dad, you-you're too big.
Ah!
Come on!
Yeah!
Yeah.
: Whoa!
Want more?
We do!
Yeah.
Whoa.
DAN: Cameron!
Cam!
HEN: Adult male, down, on the hillside.
We got three kids in a bouncy house.
All right, we're gonna stage the trucks on that service road.
Hen, I want you and Buck to rappel down, anchor that bouncy house.
Assess the condition of those kids, start to send them down one-by-one in a basket. I'll take care of the dad.
Chimney, you're gonna stay up here and work the winch.
Hey. How come I never get to do any of the fun stuff?
Working the winch is fun.
HEN : Bouncy house secure, Chim.
Copy.
Help!
Hey, guys? Hey! Hey, guys, we're...
We're L. A. Fire and Rescue. We're gonna get you out of here, okay? Everybody, just stay calm.
HEN: Hey, boys, can you tell if your friend here is okay?
Is he awake BUCK: Lower the basket down, Chim.
Copy.
Is my dad okay?
DAN: Cameron...
Sir.
Sir, do not move your head.
Stay still. We'll get you out of here as soon as we can.
DAN: Cameron...
BUCK: Chim, little lower.
Copy.
Boys, come on, let's go. Now.
BUCK: All right, that's it. Nice and easy, nice and easy.
All right, basket coming in, Hen.
Hen's going down. She's got one kid, come on.
All right.
Chim, we're good. Take me down.
BP and heart rate stable.
Vitals are stable.
Dad?
Dad!
Dan!
I thought you were dead.
I'm okay, Cam.
We're both okay.
Love you so much.
I love you so much, too.
It's okay.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Had us worried, there.
We're good down here.
You can pack it up topside.
Nice work at the winch.
Thanks.
May. May. May. Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Wake up.
May!
Mom. Mom!
What's wrong with May?
Honey. Honey, honey, honey.
Your sister isn't feeling well, okay?
I need you to go next door to the Johnsons.
Call your father, tell him to meet me at the hospital, okay?
Yeah.
All right. Lock the door.
I have to go and ride with your sister.
Pulse is weak and thready. What did she take?
Uh... hydrocodone.
Uh, do you know how many pills she took, the dosage?
They were mine from last year. I had some dental work done but didn't finish the bottle.
Maybe six or seven were left, I-I-I don't know.
Pupils aren't responding.
She's a six on the GCS, fading.
Oh...
Mommy's right here, baby.
It's okay. I'm right here.
Can you hear me?
Stay with me. Stay with me.
You're gonna be okay.
They're gonna take good care of you.
You be strong for me now, okay?
(woman speaks indistinctly over P. A.) Athena. What's up? You're not answering your phone.
I-I rushed out so fast, I forgot it.
Okay, well, what happened?
She took a bunch of pills.
On purpose? Well, what did she take?
Hydrocodone.
Okay, can...
No... she's still in ICU.
They said maybe half an hour or so.
I need to sit down.
: Ah...
Oh, God, this is my fault.
You were right, you were... you were right.
I shouldn't have told them.
They weren't ready.
Did she seem this upset to you?
I mean, I-I know it's... hard.
But this hard?
When is the last time we didn't know exactly what May was feeling?
Sh-- well, she's a teenager now.
I-I just, you know, maybe we weren't, uh, paying enough attention.
I just-- I don't know, but...
Okay, all right, let's-let's not do this right now, okay?
: Okay.
Okay.
H Uh... we...
we were having dinner, and he... and-and he drove me here.
I'm sorry. He was... he was just worried about me.
Uh...
I-I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.
Yeah, okay.
* * The last time she was in a hospital bed, I was lying in it with her, feeding her.
Yeah. It was just an hour and a half of labor.
We almost didn't make it to the hospital.
She was so damn eager to get into this world.
MAY : Mom?
Baby. Hey.
Dad's here, too.
Hey, sweetheart.
I'm sorry. I was stupid.
No, you're not stupid, honey.
You're a young girl.
Being young is hard, honey.
MICHAEL: And I'm the one that should be sorry.
I didn't see how much you were suffering with all of the stuff at home.
About me.
This wasn't because of you, Daddy.
Things have been going on.
I didn't want to tell you about them, because I was trying to handle it by myself.
What kind of things, honey?
A boy?
No.
Bunch of girls.
Mostly this one, Layla.
I don't know why they chose me.
I think because I was talking to a boy she likes, and they decided to gang up on me.
And they kept saying "you're nothing" and "you're the worst" and "you should go kill yourself" and "no one would care if you did" and "you should die." You know none of that is true, don't you, honey?
You are a special, bright light in the world.
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm.
No, I'm not.
You guys got to say that 'cause you're my parents.
I hate my life.
I'm weird. I have no friends.
What about Georgina You two are thick as thieves, now.
Not anymore.
She's with Layla now.
I didn't want to die.
It hurt so much, but I swear I didn't want to die.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Now, you listen to me.
You're strong, you're courageous, you're a champion, and you are May Grant.
And you are filled with holy fire, and no one messes with you.
No, you're not alone anymore.
And those girls?
They done picked the wrong family.
The wrong family.
WOMAN: Excuse me. Mr. and Mrs. Grant?
I'm Karen Williams.
I work for Child Protective Services.
I'm going to have to ask you not to say anything else in your daughter's presence.
MICHAEL: Athena, what is this?
When a child attempts suicide, then they need to go through an independent assessment protocol to determine why, and if they're at risk to try it again.
Okay, but we can tell you what the cause is.
No, they need to talk to her alone, find out if it had anything to do with us.
WILLIAMS: She will be admitted tonight, put on 24-hour watch, and evaluated in the morning.
MAY: I don't want to stay here.
I want to go home!
Shh...
WILLIAMS: The evaluation may take a couple of days, but we will notify you if we have to move her, and what facility she will be housed in.
You listen.
This girl just endured a life-altering trauma.
She needs to be home with her family.
Look, you don't need to do this.
You're a police officer.
You know what I'm authorized to do if you don't let me do my job.
Mama, please.
Please don't leave me.
All right.
Don't go.
Look, look, look, calm down.
All right, we all have to follow the rules.
They... they just want to find out that you're okay.
All right? Now, you tell them everything, you understand?
You're safe, and you'll be home with us in no time.
Can you be brave for me?
All right, I need you to be braver than you've ever been.
All right. That's my girl.
That's my girl. Love you.
All right, I love you.
I love you, too.
MICHAEL: I love you, baby.
* This is not right!
It's just not right.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Michael.
Now, look, my family is everything to me.
And there ain't no trouble from the inside, or even from the outside, that's gonna tear it apart.
Now, we may be buried in it up to our necks right now, and I may want to slap you with my left hand, but my right hand is holding you and the kids tight.
Now, I'm gonna make a couple of calls to some cops I know down at the CPS facility where they're taking May.
She's gonna be okay.
Come on, let's go.
Home.
Together.
* Hey, uh, Tatiana?
Do not come in here, okay?
Not while I'm cooking, please.
I kind of have this thing when I'm cooking, if somebody's watching me.
You know, I kind of get stage fright, so...
Listen, babe, you do not have to convince me not to move while somebody else does all the work.
And it smells really good.
Oh. Thank you.
Oh.
I saw the videos of that jumpy house flying through the air on the news. I cannot believe anybody survived that.
Oh, yeah, me neither.
TATIANA: Yeah.
You know, uh, when we were rappelling down to, uh, anchor the house and assess the condition of the kids, we were pretty sure we were gonna find a body or two in there.
Is it terrible that the phrase "when we were rappelling down" turns me on so much?
And dinner is served.
("Fade into You" by Mazzy Star playing) Well, you cook... you rappel down cliffs.
Mm-hmm.
You're a keeper, Chimney.
* I wanna take a breath...
Well, then, I think you will like what I have for dessert.
Ooh.
* And I see nothing...
Tatiana, I love you.
And I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
Will you please marry me?
* You go in shadows...
Chimney, it's beautiful.
And you are a beautiful man.
* And you'll go blind... * I can't tell if that's a yes.
It's not.
But it's not a no, I just...
I wasn't prepared for this at all.
Okay, it's just, it's such a surprise.
* Colors your eyes...
I-I thought this was what you wanted.
You should've asked me before you did this.
You wanted me to ask you to ask you to marry me?
I don't...
I was engaged before.
I cheated on him a week before the wedding.
I have issues with commitment.
And I just want to be really, really sure, so that I don't hurt you like I hurt Ted.
St-- wait, wait, whoa, wait, wait.
So-so, so you were engaged before?
Look, if I say no, we have to break up.
A relationship can't handle a rejection like that.
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, uh...
All that I'm really asking you to do is to just keep doing what we're doing.
Which you love.
For the rest of our lives, it-it's really-- it's not that complicated.
Just... give me a few days.
Of course.
Y-Yes.
Sure, of course.
HEN: Right here, right here, right here.
Turn left!
BUCK: I'm trying!
Oh, oh, so you're fleeing the scene?
You do realize that you lose points for murdering people on the way to a fire.
It should be fine.
It's a flesh wound. Obamacare.
What?
What? Hen! Please-- someone call HR! No-- Hen!
Ridic... Chimney!
Here. You're up.
BUCK: Aw, man.
HEN: Hey. What's...
what's wrong Look, Chim, if there's something you want to talk about...
I'm a good I mean, like, you can do a lot worse than me Chimney, I've done a whole lot worse than you.
Buck.
You think I'd be a good father?
Of course, Chim.
What is this about?
I asked Tatiana to marry me.
What?
HEN: Um...
CHIMNEY: First, she said she cheated on a fiancé that I didn't even know about, and that now we need to break up, then she said she didn't know. I...
Did you offer her the option of an open marriage?
It's super modern.
Buck.
Chim...
I'm sorry.
That may not have been the response you that you hoped for, but it's not no.
It might as well be.
Probably for the best.
What was that?
Nothing. I'm sorry.
I... I didn't mean anything by that. You doing okay?
Of course you meant something by it. "Probably for the best"?
There's a lot of meaning behind that.
What, you don't... you don't like her?
I never said I don't like her.
I don't like her for you.
CHIMNEY: And what does that even mean?
No. Come on. Come on with it, wise man, uh-- just say what you want to say, 'cause I'm getting real tired of you standing there, just silently judging me with that-- yeah, right there, with that smirk on your face.
You know, you're always so quick...
Chim.
to comment on everybody's life, but you completely shut down whenever we ask you about yours.
Why is that I mean, how long have we worked together, Bobby?
I know nothing about you.
I've never even met your wife and your kids.
You know why? 'Cause all you do is you sit there, brooding, staring in that little book of yours.
You know what? You're upset, let's drop it.
Oh, my God, Bobby. Come on, just say it! What is it?
Say it!
All right, you're living a lie, man!
You let her manipulate you.
You pretend to be somebody you're not when you're around her.
Making up stories to satisfy some hero fetish of hers? What is that?
You know what? Maybe I wouldn't have to make up stories if every once in a while, you let me take point on something.
I have to operate the winch, right?
And The Maneuver? I can do The Maneuver.
BOBBY: I know you can. That's not the point here.
Chimney, this relationship that you're in is fueled by lies.
Come on.
Y-You asked me to make you two dinner so you could pass it off as your own.
She's not in love with you.
She's in love with this fantasy version of you.
You know what? I feel real bad for your wife.
I really do.
Must be tough living with someone who thinks he's right all the time.
Chim.
I'm getting some air.
* Woman, you know, woman * You gotta be, woman * I've got the feeling of love * When you're talking to me * See right through me * I've got the feeling of alone... * Call Tatiana.
TATIANA: You've reached Tatiana. Please leave a message.
* She's gonna set you free * Yeah, yeah Come on.
* You've come looking for me * Like I've got to set you free * * You know I can't free nobody * Like I've got to set you free * * I can't be nobody Oh, my!
Hello.
Who is this?
Okay.
All right, everybody, let's gear up!
Let's go, let's go!
For what? I didn't hear a bell.
It's Chimney.
Come on. Hustle up. Hustle up, everybody, let's go!
MAN : Ladder medic, 10-36, auto emergency.
Captain Nash.
Yeah. Thanks for calling.
Your guy's this way.
He wouldn't let anyone else touch him.
You, uh... you might want to prepare yourself, sir.
Hang back, guys.
Can I get in there?
Hey, Chim.
Bobby, I...
can't move my neck.
He's alert and talking, doesn't appear to be in any pain.
Got a piece of rebar through his skull.
How is that even possible?
Oh, it's possible. Brain tissue has no nociceptors.
It can't feel pain.
Okay, what about the rest of his head?
Well, he's in shock.
Now, listen guys, this hasn't registered yet.
He knows he's pinned, but that's it, so we got to be cool.
So if this thing's right between his eyes, can he see it?
I don't know what he can see.
Airways sound good.
Not much pain.
Uh... I don't think there's any spinal damage.
I can feel my legs, but when I try and move my head...
HEN AND BUCK: Don't.
BOBBY: Be still.
Wh-Wh-Why aren't you guys, like, cutting me out of here?
It's complicated.
You've been injured, Chim.
It's not good.
Well, I want to see it.
No, you don't.
Yeah, I do. Bobby, show me.
All right.
Are you ready?
Show it to me.
All right.
Holy crap.
How come I'm not dead?
Because you are the luckiest and the unluckiest son of a bitch on the face of the earth all at the same time.
Hey, uh, you guys, I can't even feel this.
I know.
All right, well, please get me out of here before I start to...
All right, we're working on it.
Normally, I'd be consulting with my smartest EMT, but right now he's got a rebar stuck in his head.
Nice and tight, right? All right.
Yeah.
BOBBY: All right, can you move?
Not a bit.
Good. All right, Buck.
CHIMNEY: Hey, Buck.
How's the car, man? Is it a total loss?
Nah, man, you... probably buff most of that out.
Good.
Good.
Let's get O. R. 3 prepped for a decompressive hemicraniotomy.
We'll take him from here.
Wha... No, w-we're not leaving his side.
Are you family?
Buck, our job ends here at these doors like always.
* Oh, it's on too tight.
Hmm.
What is That's the perfume you like.
But I don't wear perfume.
Oh, sure you do, Pat.
You always smell wonderful.
Look, Mom.
See? It's your favorite one. Sniff.
Oh...
Is...
someone having a birthday?
I got it. I got it.
Okay.
She seems a little cantankerous today.
I know.
She's not always like that. I think, you know, big event like this...
it's a little overwhelming for her.
You look tired, Abby.
Oh my-- shut up.
Well...
That's a very rude thing to say to a woman.
Didn't mean it...
That's rude.
I'm-- I-I am worried about you.
Don't...
She's only gonna get worse, you know.
I mean, i-it's progressive.
Yes, I'm familiar with what happens with Alzheimer's.
I've done the reading.
Yeah, well.
Read this.
It's a brochure for a memory care facility.
I put Mom's name on a list, and a room has opened up.
You put her on a list for a memory care facility without asking me?
Because I knew what you would say.
You don't know what I was gonna say.
"I can handle this, Matt." Well, I can handle it, Matt.
And I know you can and you have been, and I don't tell you enough, but you are a saint for doing it.
I'm not a saint. I'm a daughter.
A saintly daughter.
Oh, come on.
Who got the short end of the stick because you're not married, you don't have any kids.
It's not fair.
Oh, my God.
Stop it. No. It's because I made a choice that I want to take care of my mother. Okay?
And-and I've never complained about it, not once.
Saints don't complain. They suffer.
I'm not suffering.
This is my choice. It's important to me.
And, you know, I have the means.
I have a really good job, she gets benefits, you help out.
We're doing this.
We're fine.
But are you living?
Matt.
I mean it, Abby. It's just...
You had something with Tommy before.
And ever since Mom has been here, you've been alone.
You got to start thinking about yourself.
And Mom's gonna need a facility like this at some point.
Just take a tour. That's all I'm asking.
BUCK: It's been, like, 14 hours.
How long's it take to pull a rod out of a guy's skull, anyway?
You ever heard of that saying, "It ain't brain surgery"?
Well, this is.
What's 3 across for when doubled in...?
Just got off the phone with the surgeon.
He's alive.
Yeah.
Any... a There were some complications when they took the rebar out.
He started hemorrhaging.
They got the bleeding under control, but had to put him in a medically induced coma.
They'll let us know if his condition changes.
You mean if he wakes up.
Or if he doesn't.
Yeah.
Buck, get the tools.
Yo, Hen.
Is it wrong I was stoked there was an emergency?
I was climbing the walls back at the house.
We all were, and, yeah, it's wrong.
We're not here to blow off steam. We're here to help.
Truck is registered out of Texas.
We're still looking for the driver.
It's got to be over 100 degrees in there.
Buck!
(knocking, people speaking indistinctly) * BOBBY: All right, get these people some water.
I got him, I got him, I got him.
BOBBY: All right, get these people some water, come on.
Put it down. Hen.
BOBBY: All right, this is truck 118.
I'm gonna need as many ambulances as we can.
Hurry up, come on.
Chopper, too.
We may have to medevac a few of them.
It's at least four and a half hours to the Mexican border, if that's even where they started.
BUCK : Come on.
Ah, breathe.
Starting compressions.
Go ahead.
OFFICER: Get down, all right, take it easy.
All right, come on. I know you can hear me.
I need you to breathe for me, okay Can you stand up? Take my hand.
Take my hand. Ready?
All right, go, go, go.
Start helping 'em down, come on.
: Por favor, mijo.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
All right, give me something.
Ah!
Javi, Javi, good job, good job.
Uh, uh... to-to-todo bien, todo bien. All right?
BUCK: Here we go, here we go, here we go.
There you go.
BUCK: Here we go, here we go, that's it.
OFFICER: Do me a favor, please, please...
Hey!
Dick! Where the hell do you think you're going?
Sick son of a bitch.
Whole families could have died in there.
Someone with a badge and a gun want to put this trash in custody Ooh, that was badass, but I thought we weren't here to blow off steam.
You know what you can blow.
Hen.
Hey, uh, everything okay?
ABBY: You answered. You always answer.
You're so sweet.
Oh, no, everything's fine.
Um, is this a bad time?
Uh, no. I'm-I'm at a call, but I-I wanted to answer and, you know, make sure...
you're not out on the ledge or something.
Thank you.
I can't believe you're at a call.
Um, I'm not on a ledge.
But I'm in a windowsill.
You're on a call.
I'm letting you go. Go back to work.
We can talk later.
Nah, come on, tell me.
No, it's just my mom.
My mom has Alzheimer's, did I tell you that? I can't remember if I told you that or not.
No, I, uh, I didn't know that.
Sorry.
Um, thanks.
And she's just...
slipping, you know?
She's getting worse, and I...
I'm starting to feel like she might need more...
than just me.
More help. Professional help.
Y Yeah. Although even as you say it out loud, I'm paralyzed with guilt at the thought of it.
I mean, she's my mom. Right?
Yeah, that's rough.
Look, I don't... I don't know a lot.
But if there's one thing I learned over the last 24 hours, the only thing that matters is family.
Right.
Yes.
You're so right.
Thank you.
Yeah, you got it.
Um...
Look, I'll talk to you soon. Okay?
Tatiana. I'm Bobby.
We spoke on the phone.
Oh, yeah. Hi.
Now I know why Chimney always calls you Gary Cooper.
I see you've had some visitors.
Yeah.
All day and last night, too.
Is that normal, or is Chimney just really popular?
Firefighters are a brotherhood.
Cops are the same way.
One of us goes down, we make sure the family's looked after.
And I'm the family?
I was hoping to convince you to come to the hospital to visit him.
I thought you said that he wasn't awake.
They're bringing him out of his coma now.
It'd be good if you were there.
He asked me to marry him.
I know.
It's not right, you know.
Putting me in that kind of situation.
Either I say yes or I'm some kind of monster.
You don't have to say yes.
You just have to come hold his hand.
This is not about love, it's about decency.
That's my point.
Anything I do now that isn't being Florence Nightingale, it makes me look like some kind of jerk.
So, I hold his hand when he wakes up.
Then it's stay with him until he's out of the hospital.
And then it's you can't break up with him until he can walk or talk again, and that's assuming that he ever can.
And you want me to just play like I'm in love for how long?
A month I am not a bad person.
I am just not in love with him.
Tatiana.
My friend is coming out of a medically induced coma.
I don't know if he'll ever fully wake up.
And if he does, I don't know if he's gonna be able to talk or see or hear or even remember who I am.
I am not asking you to love him or marry him, and I'm not judging you for your feelings. I'm not.
I'm just saying he loves you.
Misguided as he may be.
And the only two things I can think of to help him are to pray and to hope that if you're with him, he'll feel that love for you and it will give him a reason to fight his way back to us.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
ABBY: Okay.
Um, she's had her midday pills, except I think I might have used next week's day-of-the-week box by accident.
Would you mind just checking on that?
We'll get it squared away.
Thank you.
Am I about to be out of a job?
Oh.
No. My brother left that.
 Oh. Oh.
This is a good place.
Mm-hmm.
Vacancies are rare.
Huh.
Are you considering it?
I was for a minute.
But then I thought, you know, as long as my mom is still here with me...
I want her to be here with me.
We're going, we're going.
He's a tough nut.
He's gonna be in this room for a few days.
Intubation tube is out, obviously, but the catheter's still in.
Can he hear us?
I always treat them like they can.
All right, two minutes, and then I'm kicking you out.
Hey, Chim.
We're all here for you, buddy.
H-Hey.
I-I was thinking maybe when you come back to work, um, you know, you should do The Maneuver instead of me.
To motivate him to get better.
: He can't do The Maneuver.
Yeah, he can.
Hey, Chim, you can do The Maneuver.
Right?
Chim.
I, um...
I tried to get ahold of your parents.
There's a 16-hour time difference with Seoul, you know, so maybe...
maybe that has something to do with it.
BOBBY: Yeah, it's all right.
His family's right here.
Please don't ever let him do The Maneuver.
