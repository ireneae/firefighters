<strong>Abby</strong>: <em>What's your emergency?

The first kind of emergency is the one we all have, every day.

You're looking at my emergency right now.

I'm 42 years old.

It's been a year since my boyfriend Tommy broke up with me.

I'm still not over it.

My mom's a big part of my emergency.

Alzheimer's disease, late-stage.</em>

Mom, I'm going to work.

Veronica's in the kitchen.

<em>Taking care of her pretty much takes up all my free time.</em>

There's my number, right there, in case you need to call me for anything.

You don't have to tell me every time.

Sometimes you forget.

( <em>Scoffs</em> )

And then you forget you forget.

I'm hopeless, right?

No, you're not.

Careful, careful. You got it. Good, good.

( <em>Sips</em> )

Ah.

I'm healed.

( <em>Chuckles</em> )

You look good today.

Mm.

Have a good day.

Drive carefully.

I will.

Ooh, you smell good.

Woo-hoo!

<strong>Abby</strong>: <em>Then there's the second kind of emergency, the kind you never want to have, the kind that comes without warning...

The car crash, the fire, the heart attack, the break-in.

That's the kind you call me about.

I'm the actual first responder.</em>

911. What's your emergency?

<strong>Woman</strong>: My son.

He hit his head on the diving board, and he's not breathing.

<strong>Abby</strong>: What's your address, ma'am?

Uh, 242 Beatrice Lane.

I'm in Beverly Hills. Please hurry!

Okay, paramedics are on the way.

Oh, my God.

He's turning blue!

I need you to perform CPR on him.

Do you remember what to do?

30 chest compressions followed by two breaths.

Okay.

30 and two.

( <em>Indistinct radio chatter</em> )

Okay, Buck, start chest compressions.

Hen, start bagging him.

<strong>Hen</strong>: Got you, Captain.

Ma'am, come with me. I need to get my team in there.

Don't worry. He's gonna be all right.

He's gonna be all right. Please, just take a seat.

<strong>Hen</strong>: Get some of that water out.

<strong>Buck</strong>: Coming around. Starting compressions.

<strong>Chimney</strong>: Pulse ox is on. Pad's on.

How long was he underwater?

I don't know.

A few minutes, maybe.

Seven, eight, nine, ten...

Is he on any medical conditions?

No.

Is he on any medications?

No.

18, 19, 20. Go.

( <em>Defibrillator charges, thumps</em> )

No rhythm.

( <em>Sustained beep</em> )

( <em>Defibrillator charges, thumps</em> )

( <em>Whispering</em> ): Come on, kid. Come on.

<strong>Abby</strong>: <em>The crazy part is that as soon as help arrives...</em>

<strong>Hen</strong>: <em>It's coming, it's coming, it's coming.</em>

<strong>Buck</strong>: Hey. Hey, man. That's it. Get it out.

( <em>Exhales</em> )

<strong>Bobby</strong>: Good job, kid.

Good job. Good job.

All right, kid, your mom is right here.

Whew.

You're gonna be okay.

Thank you.

( <em>Whispers</em> ): You'll be okay.

( <em>Helicopter whirring</em> )

<strong>Abby</strong>: <em>I guess it's for the best that I usually don't know how it all ends.</em>

The fireman is trying to talk her down.

This is so messed up.

<strong>Abby</strong>: Are you friends with her?

Can you talk to her?

Well, we just get high together.

Everybody who's ever tried something like this and survived says the same thing: the second they step off that ledge, they regretted it.

I've been where you are.

I know how you feel.

Believe me.

There's hope.

Okay?

Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

I'll tell you all about it.

I can help you.

Please. Please.

No one can help me.

( <em>People screaming</em> )

<strong>Junkie</strong>: No, no, no, no, no, no!

She jumped. She jumped.

( <em>Line clicks, beeps</em> )

<strong>Abby</strong>: <em>Is it weird that I feel more comfortable dealing with these kinds of emergencies than the one I have to deal with when I leave work and go home?

I don't know.</em>

( <em>Phone ringing</em> )

( <em>Line clicks, beeps</em> )

911. What's your emergency?

<strong>Woman</strong>: Yeah, I'm in the drive-through, and they only gave me six nuggets in my nine-piece, and this b¡tch manager won't give me my extra nugs.

Ma'am, it's against the law to call 911 with a non-emergency.

Eat your nuggets, get some perspective, and get the hell off my line.

In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

My last confession...

( <em>Ringtone</em> ): ♪ Baby, you're a firework ♪

♪ Come on, show 'em what you're... ♪

( <em>Ringtone stops</em> )

I'm so, so sorry. Um...

I'm new.

Mm.

( <em>Chuckles</em> )

But you're familiar with the basics of how this all works?

I am fully authorized to absolve any venial sins and assign penance.

What if I have to confess a mortal sin?

I'm kidding. Do you want to do this out on the pews?

Oh. Yes. Please.

My last confession was a week ago.

I was an alcoholic.

Did some drugs, too, near the end... painkillers.

Lost a decade of my life, in and out of rehab.

Put on forced leave by the fire department.

But I got myself back together, and I've been back on the job for 18 months.

Your last confession was a week ago.

Weren't you already absolved?

It helps me to confess it all once a week, to remind myself how easy it is for me to end up on the wrong path.

But this week, I lost one. A woman.

A jumper.

<strong>Priest</strong>: It must be hard being a first responder.

The only way to survive the job is to find a way to cope with the ones you lose.

This is why you drank?

Like I said, we all find ways to cope.

Some drink, some do drugs, some gamble.

Some are sеx addicts.

I can't let her go.

Lots of fish in the sea.

Not with the bait he's using.

Cruel but true. Mm.

( <em>Hen chuckles</em> )

I met her on this new dating site just for cops and firefighters, RomancingTheUniform.com.

She's an adrenaline junkie, so foreplay is me telling her stories about running into burning buildings and jumping into icy lakes and...

I'm sorry, wait. Remind me, when is the last time you ran into or jumped over anything?

I embellish a little.

Oh. Noted.

I know we got this thing... You call me &quot;Pops,&quot; and I give you a hard time for being a dumbass kid, we went to a Springsteen concert together.

But this is not a family. It's not a clubhouse.

So I'm writing you up.

Come on, Bobby.

See the fire, put out the fire. The rest is blah-blah.

No. The system and the rules are not arbitrary.

First infraction. Two more, you're out.

Wash your hands.

Thanks.

I'm 50 years old. I'm taking the elevator.

I don't hear anything.

( <em>Sighs</em> ) Look, I'm telling you, I heard a baby crying.

Someone flushed a baby down the toilet.

Oh, I'm not high.

Okay, I-I'm pretty high, but it's a sativa.

You know? I-It makes you happy.

I-It doesn't make you hallucinate.

Give me a pen. Give me a Sharpie.

Hey!

All right.

We need to open up this wall.

No, no. We're being punked.

It's a tape recorder or something. Right, Spicoli?

Mm-mm. Maybe he's right.

Maybe a mother gives birth on the toilet and flushes it.

Okay, first of all, that's awful.

Second, do you not know how a toilet pipe works?

There's this piece of serpentine pipe that takes the waste from the toilet to...

If this is a premature baby, its bones could bend and compress like sponges.

Okay? We need to go in there.

Stand back. I got this!

Hey, hey, hey!

Did you even stop to consider that you might hit a baby?

Yeah, I didn't think so. Go get the saw.

Okay. I'm, uh, I'm gonna...

Try to find some common sense while you're down there.

( <em>Sirens wailing</em> )

Fire and Rescue were first to arrive.

Theory is that some kid gave birth on a toilet and tried to flush the evidence, which got stuck in a pipe.

Theory? Has anyone located the mother to see if the theory's correct?

How many floors above where you were hearing the crying?

Uh, floor five and floor six.

All right, let's start on five.

Knock on every door. Don't be shy about going in if something doesn't seem right.

Don't we need a warrant or something?

Do I look like I'm asking you to make an arrest?

Let's do this.

LAPD!

LAPD. LAPD.

Hey. You have a teenage girl living here?

LAPD. LAPD.

All right.

All right, let's get it out.

Guys, that-that pipe services a quarter of the toilets above us, that's gonna be messy.

Oh, shoot.

Which means, even with the water off, if somebody flushes a toilet above us, it could drown the baby.

LAPD. Open up, sir.

Do you have a teenage girl living here with you?

I wish.

<strong>Hen</strong>: Do not flush your toilet! This is LAFD.

No one flush your toilets!

Do not flush your toilet!

Oh, my God, I'm gonna start calling you &quot;Snake-ipedia.&quot;

Stop it.

Why don't I just punch it in its face?

You can't punch it in the face, Buck. It's a snake.

It's not some guy at an El Torito happy hour.

We can inject the snake. It'll pass right out.

Minutes. And minutes we don't have.

Kill it? No! No, um, no!

Kill it. Just kill it.

You're fired.

What? Wait. That's not fair. You said I got three strikes.

Doesn't matter. You've made this choice yourself, and you rubbed it in my face.

The same exact infraction two days after I wrote you up.

It's not 1950 anymore, Buck. We work with women side by side.

When you swing your dick around, you disrespect them.

Wait, Bobby! Bobby, I-I think I may be a sеx addict.

Self-diagnosed.

You think this is a joke?

No.

This a joke to you?

I'm not joking.

How much does your kit weigh when you're fully geared up?

How much?

Uh, I don't, I don't know.

60 pounds, give or take.

Right. 60 pounds.

So when you choose this life, you find a way to leave everything behind you, except that 60 pounds.

I don't care if you got problems with your wife, with money, with alcohol, with keeping it in your pants.

All that stuff weighs you down, it slows you down, and if we lose a couple seconds, people die.

So, you want to disrespect yourself, that's fine with me.

You want to disrespect these women that you chase around, that's on them, but you are done disrespecting our firehouse and this fire department.

No, Bobby. Bobby! I need this job!

Look, I love this job.

Don't do this to me.

I don't have anything else.

I'm sorry, kid. I said you're done.

( <em>Indistinct radio chatter</em> )

I guess you heard?

Yeah.

For what it's worth, everyone thinks it sucks.

It's my own fault.

Yeah.

Everyone thinks that, too.

I'll be honest.

When Bobby first brought you on board, I told him he should just get a Dalmatian instead.

( <em>Chuckles softly</em> )

But I'm legit sorry to see you go.

You got some skills.

Just not a lot of discipline.

Look, hey, um, I don't suppose you could maybe talk to him for me?

( <em>Alarm beeping</em> )

<strong>Dispatcher ( <em>over P.A.</em> )</strong>: Ladder, medic. 10-36 auto emergency.

Hey, tough break, kid.

<strong>Dispatcher</strong>: Ladder, medic. 10-36 auto emergency.

Hen, let's roll.

( <em>Sirens wailing</em> )

( <em>Horn honking</em> )

Okay, Lily, my name is Abby. I'm gonna try to help you.

What's your address?

I don't know.

We just moved here.

( <em>Door rattling</em> )

Do you know what street you live on?

Um, Lambert.

Okay, Lambert.

( <em>Crash, glass shatters</em> )

( <em>Screams</em> ) It's a brown house!

Please hurry! ( <em>Gasps</em> )

Okay, Lily? Lily?

Shoot.

What do you got here?

Residential break-in.

Caller is a nine-year-old female, home alone.

No GPS on her phone, no street address.

She did have a street name... Lambert.

There are three Lamberts in the greater L.A. area: Boyle Heights, Santa Fe Springs and Winnetka.

<strong>Lily</strong>: Abby?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can hear you.

They got in.

Where are you, honey?

Where are you?

I'm up in my room.

Okay. That's okay. What is the name of your city?

W-Winnetka.

Okay. We got to start pinging cell towers.

Pinging towers in the Valley.

<strong>Abby</strong>: Now, listen.

I need you to stay on the phone. Don't hang up.

We're gonna try to find you.

I've got multiple daytime break-ins in this area over the last couple of months.

Lily, is there anything near you that looks like it would have your address on it?

Mail or anything like that?

No.

Are you near a window? Can you look outside?

<strong>Lily</strong>: I can't see any numbers.

<strong>Terry</strong>: Towers narrow it to a quarter mile.

I know you said your house is brown. Is there anything else you can tell me about it?

( <em>Clattering</em> )

<strong>Abby</strong>: All available units, residential break-in on Lambert Road, Winnetka, somewhere between the 100 and 1500 blocks of Chanel and Hadley.

Two-story single family dwelling.

Brown house, white trim, garage door is white. Child alone in the home.

Caller says there's a pink girl's five-speed bike sitting on the front porch.

You got to be kidding me.

<em>I'm in Steven Spielberg land.</em>

Lily, are you there?

<strong>Lily</strong>: I'm here.

What's your mother's name?

Emma.

Emma Coughlin.

Okay, we got 14 Emma Coughlins.

None of them in Winnetka.

<strong>Abby</strong>: Do you know her phone number?

Uh, it's in the phone.

Here's what I want you to do.

Do not hang up the phone. Look at the menu in the phone, and read me what the number says.

Can you do that?

I think so.

Stay on the line. I'm gonna call your mom now.

Okay.

( <em>Phone ringing in distance</em> )

( <em>Ringing continues</em> )

<strong>Lily</strong>: It's ringing in her room.

Sometimes she forgets it on the charger.

( <em>Exhales</em> )

<strong>Abby</strong>: <em>Officer, maybe if you put on your siren,</em>

I could determine where you are in relation to her.

I could guide you to her.

I don't think we want these guys knowing that the cops are here.

This area's had a spate of daytime break-ins recently, and one homicide.

We need to find this girl.

Maybe we still can.

( <em>Ringtone playing</em> )

<strong>Hen</strong>: Hey. What's up, Thena?

<strong>Athena ( <em>over phone</em> )</strong>: I need a favor.

Think you can loan me a fire truck?

Um, it's kind of in use at the moment. Why?

( <em>Siren whooping</em> )

I'll have something for you in less than five.

She sent you, huh?

I was available.

All right. No heroics.

Don't go chasing waterfalls.

I don't know what that means.

Nobody thought you would.

( <em>Siren wailing</em> )

( <em>Horn honking</em> )

Lily?

( <em>Quietly</em> ): Abby, I'm downstairs.

<strong>Abby</strong>: What are you doing downstairs?

( <em>Screams</em> )

Petey! Petey!

Petey! There's a kid in the house who's got a phone.

<strong>Petey</strong>: That's twice you said my name.

Now we got to find it.

( <em>Siren wailing</em> )

<strong>Petey ( <em>over phone</em> )</strong>: I'll get this one's phone.

Just need the phone.

( <em>Siren wailing</em> )

( <em>Horn honking</em> )

( <em>Siren wailing, horn honking over phone</em> )

<strong>Dean</strong>: It's the cops!

( <em>Siren wailing</em> )

( <em>Horn honking</em> )

We've got it.

That's it.

You just passed her, cowboy.

Relax. It's just a fire truck.

Come on, kid. I just want the phone.

<strong>Buck</strong>: Oh, yeah, I see the pink bike.

( <em>Tires screech</em> )

Hey, Emma. Emma, Emma Coughlin?

Yeah.

You, uh, you can't go in there right now.

Um, why? Is there a fire?

No, no.

No, ma'am, no fire. Just come.

Well, what...?

Just get behind the truck, okay? Come on.

<strong>Petey</strong>: Come out, kid. We just want the phone.

( <em>Screaming</em> )

<strong>Dean</strong>: Petey!

I got her!

Officer, how close are you?

Close.

( <em>Petey shouts</em> )

( <em>Lily screaming</em> )

( <em>Screams</em> ) Abby!

Petey! Petey, Petey!

Petey! Petey!

Peter! Petey! Petey!

Peter! Petey!

<strong>Petey</strong>: Who is this?

This is 911 operator Abby Clark.

I need to explain something to you about this emergency.

This emergency is yours. I have dispatched the police to your exact location.

I know exactly what road they're gonna go down, I know what door they're gonna walk into, and I am prepared to help you escape.

Why would you do that?

Because I don't care about you at all, but I care about that little girl.

So you have exactly two seconds to make a decision here.

You can either walk away from her and walk away from the police, or you can sit there and wait for whatever hellfire is about to be brought down on your head.

( <em>Lily crying</em> )

<strong>Petey</strong>: Get the kid.

<strong>Lily</strong>: What?

No! No.

No! No! No!

What are you doing?! No!

No! No!

Okay, walk out the back door.

There's a road behind the house.

Back door.

What about the bike, man?

Forget the bike.

<strong>Abby</strong>: Do you see a wall?

<strong>Lily</strong>: Let me out! Please!

Do you see a wall?

<strong>Petey</strong>: Yeah, I see it.

How can you see it?

Because I have a grid of the entire neighborhood in front of me.

You're gonna go over the wall.

Better not be any cops on the other side.

<strong>Athena</strong>: There aren't.

Just needed you out of the house.

Get on the ground!

Get on the ground now!

Petey!

You lying b¡tch!

<strong>Athena</strong>: Down! Down!

<strong>Lily</strong>: Let me out! ( <em>Screaming</em> )

Fireman Buckley, what's going on there?

I don't know, uh...

<strong>Lily</strong>: Stop it!

Please! Help!

Lily!

Oh, crap.

Hello?

Help me!

<strong>Petey</strong>: Ow.

( <em>Petey grunts</em> )

( <em>Lily screams</em> )

Mom!

Lily!

Mom!

( <em>Both crying</em> )

Oh, my God.

( <em>Motorcycle engine starts</em> )

<strong>Abby</strong>: Officer.

Fireman Buckley, what's happening?

Are the suspects in custody?

Attention, all units.

Suspect on a motorcycle, heading east on Lambert.

East on Lambert.

( <em>Siren wailing</em> )

Move! Move!

Cover, cover, cover!

( <em>Gunshot</em> )

( <em>Groaning</em> )

( <em>Sirens approaching</em> )

( <em>Panting</em> )

<strong>Abby</strong>: Fireman Buckley?

<strong>Athena</strong>: Don't you move!

Don't you move.

<strong>Abby</strong>: Fireman Buckley, what's happening there?

Fireman Buckley, what's happening there?!

<strong>Petey</strong>: Ow, I'm hurt!

No, you just think you are.

<strong>Abby</strong>: I heard a gunshot. Is-is Lily okay? Where is she?

<strong>Buck</strong>: The little girl? No, she's good.

She's back with her mom, and you should be here.

Oh, my God.

( <em>Sighs</em> ) I feel like I am.

Wow. Um...

Okay, well, I can't thank you enough.

I-I... I'm so grateful.

You saved that little girl, and...

No, you did.

You kept her in the game long enough for us to find her.

You're the real hero here.

Well, I appreciate you saying that.

Thank you.

( <em>Chuckles</em> )

( <em>Sighs</em> )

( <em>Truck beeping</em> )

( <em>Brakes hiss</em> )

I know what this looks like.

Looks like you took the engine out in your street clothes.

I didn't really have time to change.

Athena Grant called me, wanted to tell me what an asset you are.

Told her she was half right.

( <em>&quot;Under Pressure&quot; by Queen playing</em> )

( <em>Line ringing</em> )

<strong>Michael ( <em>over phone</em> )</strong>: Athena.

Uh, kids get home from school okay?

Yeah, yeah.

They're inside doing their homework.

Everything okay?

Yeah. Just checking in.

You giving me another chance?

You've used all your chances, so have I.

Because somehow I have failed to communicate to you how lucky we are to do what we do.

♪ Pressure... ♪

You're wrong, Bobby.

I absolutely do get what a privilege it is to serve here.

And you know what? You were right to fire me.

I was a punk.

Uh, I still am one.

But I'm a punk who understands what he lost.

Just needed you to know that.

I hope you mean that.

So are we talking again now?

No.

<strong>Michael</strong>: You want us to wait for you for dinner?

<strong>Abby</strong>: <em>You know, it takes a certain kind of person to swim in the pain of the world and not get wet. To run towards danger, rather than run away from it. And for those of us that choose this life, there's no place we'd rather be.</em>

911. What's your emergency?
