That pan is still wet.
You need to dry it off before you put it away.
Why? It'll dry eventually.
Because it'll rust.
That's my good cast iron.
And don't you roll those eyes at me.
Sorry, Mama.
When's Daddy getting home?
Oh, I see.
You only offered to help with the dishes so you could wait up for your father.
Well, yeah. Who likes doing dishes?
Besides you.
I like it because it's usually my peaceful time by myself.
One day when you're grown, you'll understand.
(door opens) SAMUEL: I'm home.
(door closes) Saved by your daddy again.
Daddy!
You missed dinner.
Oh...
Oh, I know, baby girl.
Daddy got a flat tire on the way home.
(chuckles) Mm. Ooh.
Is that why you smell like a greasy mechanic?
And look at this shirt. It's filthy.
Well, you want me to take it off so you can wash it?
'Cause you know I got no problem with that.
(laughs): Oh, Samuel Carter, get those filthy paws off me.
What? I can't help it.
(scoffs) And you, little girl-- it is officially past your bedtime.
What about story time? Daddy always tells me a story before bed.
I know, baby.
Daddy got home too late.
But I promise I will make it up to you.
Tomorrow we will read two stories.
And waffles for breakfast?
And waffles for breakfast.
(giggles) BEATRICE: Some lawyer you are.
You just got out-negotiated by a nine-year-old.
I'm a tough cookie.
That's what Daddy always tells me.
Just like her mother.
(sighs) Go.
(chuckles) (crickets chirping) (knocking in distance) PATRICE: Samuel! Beatrice!
BEATRICE: Patrice? What's the matter?
PATRICE: Is Tanya here? She's gone. We can't find her.
BEATRICE: Patrice, slow down. What do you mean, she's gone?
PATRICE: She's not in the house. She wasn't in her bed.
BEATRICE: Where would she go?
I don't understand.
What's happening?
Tanya's missing.
PATRICE: When Joanne to check on her she wasn't in her bed.
It was empty. Their window was open.
(cries out) SAMUEL: Did you check the backyard?
These kids are always doing stuff they're not supposed to.
Me and Lloyd have looked everywhere. She just vanished.
I'll get a search group together.
Hey, come on.
Okay, it's okay, it's gonna be all right.
Patrice, go back to the house.
Wait there in case she shows.
PATRICE: Yes.
Beatrice.
Call the sheriff, give them the Kingston's address, let 'em know what's going on.
I just have this sick feeling that something's happened to her.
No.
I can feel it in my bones.
Don't go there.
Athena.
Go back to your room and get in bed. Now!
BEATRICE: I thought your father told you to go back to bed.
(window closes) I'm scared.
You don't have to be scared.
I am right here.
What happened to Tanya?
Why did Daddy grab his gun?
Tanya's parents don't know where she is.
Your father went out to help them find her.
Did something bad happen to her?
We don't know yet.
But you know what you can do to help?
Pray.
Why don't you say a prayer asking God to bring Tanya home safe and sound.
You remember what I told you?
That God answers prayers.
That's right.
Please let Him answer this one.
Now try and get some sleep, okay?
MAN (in distance): Tanya!
MAN 2: Tanya! Tanya!
WOMAN: Tanya!
MAN 3: Tanya!
Tanya!
WOMAN: Tanya, can you hear me?
MEN: Hello? Tanya? Do you hear me?
Tanya!
(siren wailing in distance) MAN 2: Tanya!
MAN 3: Tanya!
MAN: Tanya Kingston!
MAN 2: Tanya!
MAN: Tanya!
MAN 3: Tanya!
(monitor beeping steadily) BEATRICE: Why aren't you doing anything?
You're just standing there, letting that man treat your father like a criminal.
This is protocol, Mama.
He's doing his job.
Mrs. Carter?
The detective is almost done in there.
This isn't right and you know it.
Your father can't speak or defend himself.
He can't even consent to what they're doing.
They don't need consent, Mama.
That's what the warrant is for.
PINO: Well, everything else aside, Mr. Carter is showing signs of improvement.
His blood pressure has been stable for the last 24 hours.
The swelling in his brain has gone down considerably.
Enough to maybe bring him out of the coma?
That's what we're hoping.
I'll keep you posted.
Thank you.
The police are gonna want to talk to him as soon as he wakes up.
You keep these people away from your father.
Look at what they're doing to him.
BOBBY: Beatrice, I know this is difficult, but the police are just doing what they have to, and gathering samples is probably the best way to prove that Samuel is innocent.
He's right.
Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Nash.
Detective Clifford Dixon.
You people should be ashamed of yourselves.
The police department did nothing for 45 years to find that girl, now you want to pin it on a sick, incapacitated man.
My husband did not do what you're accusing him of.
Ma'am, we haven't accused him of anything.
Yet.
We just want to get to the truth, like I'm sure you do.
Because you're right, 45 years is a long time.
And the Kingston family deserves some justice.
So what happens next?
We're still sorting through the evidence and samples from the scene, but once we have forensics, we can test Mr. Carter's sample against it.
And I'd like to get you and your mother down to the station to give statements.
I know it was long time ago, but anything you might remember from that night could be helpful.
Not without a lawyer.
DIXON: That's fine. At your earliest convenience.
Can I give you some free advice, though?
Can I say "no thank you"?
Let go of your emotional attachment.
Let us do our jobs.
Just be his daughter.
Not a police officer.
ATHENA: Right. I know.
Oh, no, he's over there.
(stammers) Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, no, no, no, no, no. No, Michael.
I'm telling you, do not come.
No, keep Harry there with you and David.
He does not need to be here for this.
Look, I got to go. We just got back to the house.
Kiss Harry for me.
Okay, bye.
Junior's here.
ATHENA: And he brought his father.
I am so sorry.
One shock after another.
Still doesn't feel real.
Mr. Franklin.
Aw, it's good to see you.
It's been a while.
I would say it's good to see you, too, but...
not under these circumstances.
How you holding up?
Oh, best we can.
What about your mother?
She's still at the hospital. On top of everything, my father-- he's still not out of the woods.
She doesn't want to leave his side.
Of course. I wanted to come by when I heard about Samuel's stroke.
But then I saw the news last night.
Mm.
Anything me or Junior can do to help, don't hesitate to ask.
Now, who's this-- your bodyguard?
Bobby Nash, my husband.
Ah.
Nice to meet you, sir.
Good to meet you.
Glad you're here.
She's gonna need all the support she can get.
Now, you built the original structure, correct?
Yeah.
Laid the foundation myself.
JUNIOR: Uh, the police questioned him about it.
We just got back from the station.
They swabbed me for the DNA.
What do you remember?
I was so young, it's all kind of a blur.
All I can tell you is what I told the police.
I poured that concrete, left it to cure four, maybe five days.
I remember it was so humid, had to give it extra time.
The job site was exposed to the street.
Anyone could have put that girl in there.
It was long time before home security cameras.
(chuckles) This Florida room has been here so long, it's hard to remember a time when it wasn't.
Your mom had been on your dad for years to build that addition.
But he kept putting it off, saying he didn't have the money.
Then one day, he came by the shop.
Said he changed his mind.
Hmm, why the sudden change of heart?
You got to understand.
When that girl disappeared, it rocked this town.
Nobody was the same after that.
He said it'd be a good distraction.
A fun project for you and Beatrice.
When did he ask you to build it?
The day after the Kingston girl went missing.
JUNIOR: We've taken up enough of your time. We'll get out of your hair.
But if you need anything at all, we're here.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
Come on, Pops.
I'm sorry, Athena.
I really am.
Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
See ya.
Take care.
Okay.
BOBBY: Hey.
You doing all right? I know I keep asking you, but I've just been really worried about you.
(sighs) (car door closes) I'm not sure how I'm feeling.
(engine starts) REGGIE: Y'all take care.
(engine sputtering, popping) (exhales) What are... what-what are you doing?
I'm trying to see if there's anything here that might shed some light.
Did you know your father was a meticulous record keeper? He keeps all his old appointment books.
Oh, no, put that away, right now. All of it.
This is not yours to do.
You-you have no right to go through my father's things like this.
You're right, I don't.
It should be you.
What I don't understand is why it's not.
Why are you just standing on the sidelines?
Because that detective was right.
I'm not a police officer here.
Well, who cares what he said? Don't you want to clear your father's name?
Of course I do...
Athena, those doctors said they're gonna take Samuel off sedation in two days, and like you said, the police are gonna be there waiting for him.
Don't you want to be armed with the truth when they do show up?
What is it? What are you so afraid of?
I'm afraid he could have done it.
(softly laughing) (clears throat) GIRL: There's that girl.
The one whose little sister got kidnapped.
Don't touch me.
GIRL 2: Her name is Joanne.
I heard she got kicked out of school.
JOANNE: I said let go!
PATRICE: Have you lost your mind?
JOANNE: Oh, don't pretend you all of a sudden care about the one kid you have left.
PATRICE: Stop it.
Why are you always making my life so hard?
After everything I've been through.
JOANNE: Oh, right, because you're the only one this has happened to.
You know what, I think Daddy died just to get away from you.
Okay, how about we try to calm down here?
Shut up, Barney Fife.
Maybe you should try looking for my sister instead of harassing me.
You people are worthless.
Shut up.
Let's go.
Oh, hey there, little lady. I hope you're being careful out there.
Why does everyone keep saying that you're bad at your job?
Is it because you haven't found Tanya?
You shouldn't listen to everything everybody says.
Was Tanya your friend?
I saw her at school all the time and church.
Are you still looking for her?
Of course we are.
The truth is this is a really hard case.
We don't have a lot of clues to help us find her.
And you need clues.
Like a barrette in the woods.
How'd you know about that?
I heard my dad talking about it.
Is that the only clue you have?
Well, the only other thing we know is that somebody climbed in through that bedroom window and took her.
What about Joanne?
Why did you arrest her?
You sure do ask a lot of questions.
I like to know stuff.
I didn't arrest her.
I was just making sure she got home safe.
She's having a hard time.
I wish I could help her and her mom.
Me too.
Stay safe.
(engine starts) ♪ ♪ SAMUEL: You shouldn't be snooping around people's property.
I just...
wanted to see it for myself.
You always do.
Sometimes you got to know when not to let your curiosity get the best of you.
Don't go looking for stuff.
You might not like what you find.
Your father came home late that night.
I'm sure it wasn't the first time.
Yeah, when he came in, his shirt was all dirty.
He said he had a flat tire.
I mean, I remember because my father was always such a sharp dresser.
And that night he was disheveled.
I wasn't used to seeing him like that.
But you said he was out helping with the search.
He did, but lots of folk go back to the scene of the crime.
The same night, Bobby.
That's one hell of a coincidence.
Yeah, but this is your father we're talking about. He raised you.
You know he's not capable of doing anything remotely like this.
Anybody at any time is capable of doing a horrible thing.
I see it every day, so do you.
You know how many times I go to make an arrest and the family can't believe it?
Living under the same roof with a killer, and they had no idea.
The devil wears a familiar face and tricks you with his lies.
That sounds like something Beatrice would say.
I love my father, God knows I do.
He's my hero.
But he's just a man.
He could have had a life outside this house that I knew nothing about.
Then you need to find out the truth for yourself.
Before it's too late.
Oh, but w-what if I go looking and find something that proves the worst?
Am I supposed to hand that over to the police to arrest my father?
I can't be the one to send my father to prison.
You could be the person who clears his name.
ATHENA: House looks exactly the same.
Older and run down, but...
everything's as it was.
They even have the same flower boxes.
Still loose.
JOANNE: What the hell are you doing?!
ATHENA: Joanne, it's me.
Athena Carter.
All the more reason to shoot you right here.
Daughter of a murderer.
Okay, let's just stop, take a minute.
Don't do anything we're gonna regret.
JOANNE: Oh, I won't regret this.
Her father killed my sister.
See?
She can't even deny it.
Get off of me!
Joanne, I just want to talk.
Let go.
JOANNE: You got some nerve coming here.
I'm here because I want answers.
Just like you.
Am I supposed to feel sympathy for you?
Your father is a murderer.
He ruined my life.
And now you are here because he has ruined yours, too.
I know how hard this has been on your family.
I got no family left.
I imagine that must...
... tear you up inside.
What do you want to talk about?
I stopped coming in here after she was gone.
My mother kept it like a shrine.
Said she was keeping the room ready for when she came back home.
After Mama was gone, I...
I put a padlock on it and that was it.
A lot of painful memories.
You shared this room with your sister?
I hated it.
Nosy little sister.
She was always in my business.
ATHENA: This is the window they used when they took her.
JOANNE: How do you know?
The flower box.
It's loose. I remember it being loose back then, like someone stepping on it, which could have happened from climbing in.
Mm-hmm.
Looks like it's been stepped on more than once.
ATHENA: He's right.
You used to sneak out of this window, didn't you?
Did you sneak out that night?
Yes.
Tanya and I both did.
Sneaking out again, huh?
I'm meeting up with friends.
We're hanging out.
Does Mom know?
The only way Mom would know is if you tell her.
And we both know you're not gonna do that, so go to sleep.

30 minutes? That's no time. An hour.

<i> ADULT JOANNE:</i> <i> I never saw her leave.</i> <i> Just assumed she made it home.</i> And you lied to the police back then?
Lied to my parents, too.
Told them that she was gone when I checked on her.
They saw the window was open.
It was easier to let them believe that.
Then they told the police what happened.
It was my fault.
If I hadn't snuck out that night, she'd still be here.

You don't know that.
Did you call the police?
You were trespassing.
(car doors close) It's okay, everything's fine.
I'm not gonna press charges.
Not sure that's up to you now.
Mrs. Nash, I thought we had an understanding that you were gonna let us do our job.
ATHENA: We were just leaving.
We came by to offer our condolences to Joanne.
That's all.
Is that right?
Because it looks a lot like your wife is interfering with an active investigation.
How about you come with me?
Wait a minute, you're arresting her?
In all fairness, you were warned.
(engine starts) <i> BOBBY:</i> <i> Can't imagine they'd book her.</i> Question her, sure, but she'll still need a lawyer.
Okay. Thanks. I will meet you there.
I'm sorry I got Athena in trouble.
Well, she can handle it, she's a police officer herself.
Well, that explains it. (chuckles) I want you to know that Athena's probably gonna tell the police what you told us: that Tanya wasn't taken from home.
That's new information that'll probably be helpful to them.
(sighs) There's something else.
That car we heard-- we couldn't see it from where we were hiding, but the sound it made, it was like a "put-put-put." I'd never heard a car sound like that before.
Okay, that's good to note.
I'll bring that up to Detective Dixon.
Listen, Joanne, you take care of yourself.
And lock that thing up.
<i> DIXON:</i> <i> So, what were you doing</i> <i> talking to Joanne Kingston?</i> One could think it was intimidation.
And one would be wrong.
Did you know that Tanya wasn't taken from her house like the Kingstons reported?
Did Joanne tell you that?
She did.
That night, she snuck out, and Tanya followed her.
All this time, you've been trying to solve this case with wrong information.
Not all of us.
The barrettes.
I got three little girls at home.
They never go to bed with their barrettes.
Always complaining to my wife about how much it hurts.
If she was taken from her sleep, I don't think she would have been wearing those.
Well...
I guess I confirmed it.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Is that the forensic report from the scene?
What else was found with the remains?
Not much.
Few scraps of cloth, the barrettes, plastic.
Everything else was disintegrated.
What about this? What is it?
Old-timers think it's a clasp from a harvesting bag.
Like they use for picking oranges.
Bags back then were canvas, so the clasp is all that's left.
The killer could have used something like this to transport her.
It's possible.
DNA?
Nothing.
Nothing to compare your father's sample to or Reggie Senior's.
Either it was wiped clean or, more likely, the hydrated lime in the concrete eroded any DNA that was present.
Hydrated lime.
That's usually mixed in with the concrete, yes?
Typically.
The levels here-- it looks like she was doused in it.
Like someone poured the lime all over her, then covered her body in the wet cement.
What's the difference?
Reggie Senior.
He said that he poured the foundation, then left it to cure. He said, "Anyone could have put that little girl in there." That is a very deliberate choice of words.
Deliberate because it wasn't true.
Exactly.
He covered her body in quicklime, knowing that it would erode all evidence, Then he encased her in cement.
(knocking) REGGIE: Knock, knock.
Special delivery.
Reggie.
What a wonderful surprise.
Just came by to see how you were doing.
And bring a little something to eat.
Got to keep your strength up.
Well, thank you.
How is he?
Improving.
They're hoping to take him off sedation in another day or two.
That so?
Seems like a lifetime.
Waiting like this.
Not knowing, and then, with everything else...
Beatrice.
I am so sorry.
It shouldn't be happening to you.
You and Samuel.
You don't deserve this.
Samuel is a good man.
You know it.
The whole town knows it.
To have his legacy tainted like this after all he's done.
REGGIE: I wish I could take it away.
I wish I could make it right.
You're not the one making my husband out to be some kind of killer.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, Beatrice.
<i> JOANNE:</i> <i> But the sound it made.</i> <i> It was like a "put-put-put."</i> <i> I never heard a car</i> <i> sound like that before.</i> (engine sputtering, popping) (phone vibrates) Hey. <i> BOBBY: Athena,</i> <i> I know who it is. It's Reggie.</i> <i> Joanne said she remembered</i> <i> hearing a car that night.</i> Said the engine had a very specific sound.
Said you couldn't mistake the sound of that thing.
It was Reggie's truck. <i> Bobby,</i> I saw the forensic report.
Tanya wasn't put<i> in</i> the wet cement.
<i>The cement was poured over her.</i> Reggie lied.
Are you still with Joanne? <i> No,</i> I'm at the orange grove right now. I was on my way to you, but then I saw Reggie's truck <i> parked off to the side</i> <i>of the road, but he's not in it.</i> I need to go warn Joanne.
(door creaks open) How did Reggie find Tanya that night?
Someone would have noticed an adult at the bonfire.
It doesn't make sense.
But Joanne heard Reggie's truck.
<i> ATHENA:</i> <i> This boy</i> chased me all through the orange groves.
(laughing) Reggie Senior wasn't the only one in that house <i> with a driver's license.</i> (gasps) Junior.
What are you doing here?
Taking care of loose ends.
JOANNE: Junior, please.
Why are you doing this?
I'm gonna help the police solve your sister's 45-year-old case.
The sister did it.
What?!
What are you talking about?
That night, when she crashed the party at the bonfire, you let her drink.
A lot.
And, of course, it was a tragic accident when you found her passed out and not breathing.
The guilt.

You know, the next day after she was gone, he came over.
Wanted to see how I was doing.
I thought it was because he cared.
He just wanted to see if I knew anything.
Have you given any thought to what comes next?
I don't know.
Sell the house, maybe.
Fresh start.
Only reason I stayed was in case she came home one day.
Guess I never gave up hope, either.
Well, hope is a good thing.
It always feels like everyone forgot about her.
People searched the first couple of months, but then they went on with their lives.
Not everyone forgot.
I didn't.
Tanya may have only been on this earth for eight short years, but she had a big impact.
I never forgot your sister.
<i> (elevator dings)</i> (indistinct chatter) (gasps) What happened?
All they said was to hurry up and get down here.
Your father is awake.
What?
And he's asking for you.
Daddy?
I was telling him about Tanya, and how you never gave up.
It's in her nature.
Well, I didn't steal it.
You and Mama made me that way.
