Firefighter Buckley here pulled out the very last victim.
Of course he did.
Yeah, then everyone else had to pull me out.
Well, I'm sure whoever you saved is just glad you were being Buck.
I don't even know what that means.

Hi.

Did that go okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
Is it gonna be okay with Maddie?
Chim, I can't...
You're totally allowed to be mad at her.
But if you can find a way to forgive them, you've gotta find a way to forgive her.
She should've told me.
She didn't want you to think that you weren't wanted.
That you weren't loved.
You know what? I wasn't.
Yes, you were. By her.
She sent me away, Chim.
I needed her, and she wasn't there.
She just handed me keys to a car, sent me on my way so that I didn't mess up her life.
The Jeep?
That's what you're talking about?
Of course you know about that. (<em>Chuckles</em>)
More than you, apparently.

So Mom and Dad came to the firehouse.
Wanted me to forgive them.
I did.
Wow.
That must have been difficult.
The thing is, not really.
'Cause it's hard to feel betrayed by someone that you didn't really think you could count on anyway.
And easy to lash out on the person that you know is always gonna forgive you.
I know that I hurt you.
And if I could take it back...
But I keep thinking about that.
What life would be like if I would've known.
Would I still be me?
Oh, I'm pretty sure you would always be Buck.
Would you... would you tell me about Daniel?
I can't ask Mom and Dad, but I would like to know what he's like.
Yeah.
Yeah, it would be nice to talk about him again.
