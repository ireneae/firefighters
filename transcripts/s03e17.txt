No, you're not fine.

You ready?
Yeah, I'm not really feeling too well, so it's probably not a good idea for me to go to the hospital.
Just give Athena my love.
(<em>Cartoons play indistinctly</em>)
Are you sure?
Yeah, positive.
I hear Athena's gonna be okay.
Yeah, Buck called from the hospital and said that she's in rough shape, but nothing life-threatening.
Although I will be having nightmares about it for a while.
Yeah, hearing her struggle?
Not being able to help her?
But hey, gives us something new to talk about in therapy.
(<em>Laughs</em>) Well, that's great.
'Cause I was starting to think that I was boring Frank.
You know, you could talk to him about going to court.
You think I should do it.

No.
I just think that you should consider what it means if you don't do it.
You keep saying that you feel powerless.
Maybe if you face him and tell him how you feel, you'll get your power back.

What am I looking at here?
Proof that Hen is cheating on me.
What? Hen would never do that.
I mean, not after what happened the last time she did that.
She's got all these dates and the name of a hotel.
I mean, is that when she's planning to meet up with this Imelda?
You find anything else on her phone?
Nothing. It was locked.
I took a picture of the screen.
Oh, did you use her thumb to unlock it while she was sleeping?
Ew. No.
Wait, do you do that?
Of course not!
Buck did it to me once after I got stabbed.
Anyways, look, it's just two text messages and a scrap of paper.
It probably means nothing.
There's a charge on our credit card.
A teppanyaki restaurant.
She said she took you there for your birthday.
Is that true?

I cannot believe she lied about that.
I love teppanyaki.
See? Another lie.
Right to my face.
She's using me to lie to you.

Imelda.

Imelda is Dr. Royce.
Dr. Imelda Royce.
Oh, a doctor.
At least that's better than the last one.
I'm a doctor too!
I have a PhD. Wait.
Dr. Royce is that surgeon... the surgeon you met the day that you put your hand in that man's chest.
Ah!
Which... was really stupid and reckless, by the way.
Okay, maybe you should stop talking now.
She had a meet-cute over an open chest wound.
That's not right!
It wasn't a meet-cute.
It was just a meet.
And I was talking to Dr. Royce... Imelda... about what it took to get into med school.
These are the dates of when I can take my MCATs.
Wait, you're thinking about going to medical school?
