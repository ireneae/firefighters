(birds chirping) (dog barking in distance) DAVID (chuckles): Look at that.
It's better than the pictures, Dad.
Could I take a look at my room?
(sighs) Have at it.
Yes. Yes!
Come on, Jamie.
Go on. I'll be right behind you.
JAMIE: Alex, wait up!
(Alex laughing) (laughs softly) We made it, babe.
JAMIE: Need some help?
Hey.
Just, uh, yeah, moving is overwhelming, you know?
I miss her, too.
This was her dream house.
If she hadn't been in remission, I never would have gone through with it.
I just wish she was here to see it.
She's here.
Hey, buddy.
JAMIE: Don't worry, Dad.
We're gonna get through it, together.
It's all gonna be okay.
(car alarm beeping) (Jamie screams) (tires screeching) Alex. Alex!
(phone beeping) AUTOMATED VOICE: You have reached a number that is not in service.
If you feel you have reached this number in error, please check the number and try again.
Check the number? It's 911.
BUCK: Okay, so every unit is different, but I think I kind of like this one the best.
Nice. You should totally rent that apartment.
M-Me? Wh-Why...why would I?
Because I have my own apartment.
You sleep in my dining room.
Y-You don't think it's weird?
Yes. That's why you should get your own place.
Okay, fine. It's a little weird to go back to my apartment, but...
I'm not just gonna force myself out of it because...
I got stabbed, and it totally sucked.
But then I remembered something a wise man once said: "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." Ah, wise men of history: Aristotle, Solomon, Dr. King, Bueller, Bueller.
Don't mock me. I'm convalescing.
Anyways, Ferris Bueller only had one day off.
I have weeks of free time, and I'm determined to make the most of it.
Last time I almost died, I didn't get to have any fun at all.
Is that why you're turning all your clothes into index cards?
Not all of them.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to determine if this shirt sparks joy, and I did, and it doesn't.
And now I thank the shirt.
Thank you.
Okay.
You need therapy, Chim.
(laughs) MADDIE: I will still see my therapist.
I'll go to my support group, but I have to start putting little pieces of my life back together, and work is a very big piece.
It seems like, maybe, you're moving too fast.
You need time to heal.
I've been healing, for weeks.
I'm sick of resting, I'm tired of talking about my feelings, and I just want to go back to the real world.
Even if you're not ready?
Once my life is normal again, then I will feel normal again.
HEN: You both just almost died.
Now you're just gonna prance over to her place and pick her up for dinner like it never happened?
No. Maddie is coming over here to pick me up, because she is a modern woman.
And also, I'm pretty sure they couldn't get the bloodstains off that brick.
(laughs softly) So I guess Maddie still sparks joy?
Always.
BUCK: Okay, so where are you gonna take Chimney on your "second first date"?
I have no idea.
(chuckles) BOBBY: Don't panic, because panic can be more dangerous than flames, toxic fumes or a sucking chest wound.
Guys?
Cap's a little intense, huh?
Oh, he takes these talks very seriously.
BOBBY: And all you need are three numbers.
Can anyone tell me what they are?
ALL: 911!
Yes. Now, does anybody know what happens when you dial those numbers?
Harry Grant.
They call a fire truck.
Hmm. So much for playing it cool.
Well, who's doing that?
Our son.
He didn't want the other kids thinking he had the inside track just 'cause he knows the captain.
Oh, well, that went out the window as soon as he walked through the door.
(both laugh) And now, what if I told you that a big computer brain helps you when you dial 911?
It is called CAD, Computer Aided Dispatch.
Let's say you, Harry, call in an emergency. Can you name one?
The library sets on fire, and all our homework assignments are burned up.
(chuckles): Okay, there you go.
All right, so when you dial 911, the dispatcher types in your address into the computer, and then CAD automatically finds your school, then finds the nearest station and...
(alarm ringing) HEN: Station 118, Station 118, please dispatch a fire engine and an ambulance to the Meadowbrook School Library immediately.
Harry Grant didn't do his homework.
(laughter) BOBBY: All right, guys, who wants to check out the trucks?
ALL: Me!
All right.
Follow Buck and Eddie.
Come on, guys.
I want this side with me. Let's go, let's go!
Watch out. (laughs) Come on!
Yeah, seriously. There you go.
Great performance, sir. I enjoyed every nuance.
Oh, well, thank you, I guess I'm a method actor.
(laughs): Yeah.
Hey, what are you, on your lunch break, or you just love TED Talks for ten-year-olds?
Are you kidding me?
These tickets are harder to get than Hamilton.
(chuckles) Will I see you later?
Absolutely, you will.
Ooh.
All right, baby.
KYLE: I still can't believe your new dad's the captain.
That's so cool.
He's pretty badass.
Not just with, like, fires and stuff.
Like, during the earthquake, he saved, like, hundreds of people.
All we did was hand out bottled waters.
(siren wailing) (phone ringing) MADDIE: 911. What is your emergency?
No, ma'am, an ice bath will not help you break the baby's fever.
WOMAN: A steam shower?
Steam shower's not good, either.
It's only gonna raise her temperature.
Tell me your baby's name.
Jessalyn.
She's at 103.
103 is high, but not in the danger zone.
Is Jessalyn eating and producing urine?
Mm-hmm.
Then she's gonna be fine.
If the fever's there in an hour, take her to the ER.
Oh, thank God. Thank you.
You're welcome.
911. What is your emergency?
WOMAN 2: My husband.
He's choking on a shrimp tail.
Y-You're gonna want to get your hands under his sternum and squeeze as you lift.
(woman 2 grunting) (man coughing) It worked!
Oh.
I'm so glad. Last thing your husband needed was a shrimp tail stuck in his throat.
(cell phone vibrating) Look me in the eye.
What?
I'm checking on you.
Ugh.
Everyone is checking on me.
I would tell you that I'm fine, but you probably won't believe me, either.
How's Chimney?
He's good.
We're gonna finish what we started.
Oh, the-the first date that we never had.
Hope you have a good plan for the man that almost died for you.
Still working on it.
I'll think of some recommendations while I'm saving lives.
(chuckles) (phone ringing) 911. What's your emergency?
MAN: I need help.
Brakes gave out on my truck.
I had to use a turnout.
Have you been hurt?
Pretty sure my ankle's broken.
And I've made a hell of a mess of things.
I'm at Kanan, near the PCH.
Don't worry, sir. I'm sending you help right away.
(crackling, beeping) Sir?
Sir, can you hear me?
(electronic crackling) (indistinct muttering) (beeping) SUE: It's a level three outage.
The power is on, but the entire CAD system is down.
The digital phone lines are routed through the network, so no computers, no calls.
But the analog lines still work.
We're going old-school. Red for fire, white for police, yellow for medical.
Write down important details, figure out what resources you need, use the walkie to dispatch resources to the scene.
There are no blinking lights on the map.
So, from your caller, get cross streets and landmarks.
And if you are unfamiliar with where they are calling from, look it up.
(alarm ringing) Okay, everybody, we are in Tactical Emergency Mode.
That means we will not be at the station today.
We will be driving all around the district to make sure that we are ready for anything that comes our way.
Cap, you do realize we work here, right?
We're trained professionals, not fifth-graders.
Yeah, right?
Sorry.
This is a street atlas.
All of Los Angeles in one handy volume.
Maps on paper, people. And yes, they still make them.
Street numbers are located on the maps and also in the index.
EDDIE: Hey, Cap. You ever seen a breakdown like this before?
Once in St. Paul.
Blizzard took out the power grid around the call center and backup generator.
I've been through, like, three of these.
I'm surprised they don't happen more often, the way the city funds us.
Department's held together by chewing gum and spit.
Hey, come on, I like these old trucks.
Uh-huh. I like them when they run.
JOSH: It will be chaos.
Help each other through it.
Call out errors, correct mistakes.
See it, say it, repeat it.
We did it this way for 20 years.
We'll do it again today.
JOSH (over radio): 118 Engine and Rescue, please report your location.
BOBBY: We're on Granville, approaching Miracle Mile District from the west.
JOSH: Please proceed to 9590 Hillcrest.
Cross street is Meadows.
Vehicle collided with a 58-year-old cyclist, male.
Copy. 118, Battalion Seven en route.
So, you didn't do it there, where did you do it?
(news fanfare playing) Good morning, everybody.
Oh, come on.
We're learning that Metro L. A.'s 911 system has been hit with a system-wide outage.
We're gonna be posting alternate numbers.
We'll put them on the screen here for you and on our website.
Department staffers are also monitoring social media and urging you to use the hashtag "911-L. A." Now, officials are saying that only about 30% of these emergency calls are gonna be able to get through, so please only call 911...
Okay, this might be a better show.
...if it is a life-threatening emergency.
* That's great, it starts with an earthquake *
* Birds and snakes and aeroplanes *
* And Lenny Bruce is not afraid *
* Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn *
* World serves its own needs...* Get these cars routed around the scene and shut down these two lanes.
* With a fear of height, down, height...* Dispatch, this is 118. 122 is already on the scene.
JOSH: Copy that. Maintain Emergency Protocol.
* With the Furies breathing down your neck...* BOBBY: Copy that. 118 on the move.
Wait, is that the vehicle versus cyclist on Hillcrest?
I sent the 122. I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's gonna happen. Um, Vicky, Jeanette, Andre, start walking the floor and flag all duplicate calls.
Make sure one ends up on the boards. Got it?
Sure you don't want to take another three weeks off?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, but we're not giving any tours today.
You should return your passes to the receptionist and reschedule.
MAN: Don't think my ASAC will like that.
(scoffs) You're FBI?
Anders is our data breach and recovery expert.
Nina is a critical infrastructure specialist.
I'm Devon, systems analyst, cyberterrorism.
So you think we've been hacked?
We're operating on that assumption.
ANDERS: Doesn't take much. In 2016, a single web address went viral on Twitter.
People clicked on it, and their phones started speed-dialing 911.
DEVON: The attack in Atlanta last year was traced back to Russian hackers.
The city spent more than $2.6 million trying to unlock their systems, rather than pay the ransom demand of $50,000 in Bitcoin.
Ransom demand?
Yes.
And that's what we're hoping for, because the moment they hit us with it, we'll be ready.
(elevator bell dings) (sighing): Okay, okay.
(strained grunting) Is it bad?
(chuckles) Please tell me it's not bad.
On a scale of one to ten, it's about a 40.
We're not gonna make it.
Ooh!
We'll be fine, Roger. We just got to get to the car...
Aah!
Whoa.
Did your water just break?
Yeah.
Yeah, broke.
Okay, all right.
Okay.
Ooh!
Call 911. (yells) We've got an Uber on the way.
O-Okay, okay.
(cell phone dialing) AUTOMATED VOICE: You have reached a number that is not in service.
What do you mean, it's not in service?
How is 911 not in service? (panting) (line ringing) Thank God.
LINDA: 911. What's your emergency?
Yeah, my wife is having a baby.
Engine 118, Rescue 118, report to 550 San Vicente.
Woman in labor, geriatric pregnancy, contractions very close.
BOBBY: Copy that.
118 en route to 550 San Vicente.
(sirens wailing) (Sonia shouting) Need some pillows?
The contractions are right on top of each other.
This is not good.
(screaming) It's okay. I got it.
Where the hell is the ambulance?
(sirens wailing) Dispatch, this is 118.
There is nothing here.
No pregnant woman?
There's no building. It's an empty lot.
LINDA: Stand by, 118.
Hey, Linda, did you say San Vicente?
Yeah. Woman in labor in the lobby of a high-rise.
Yeah, it's the wrong San Vicente. There's three.
118, you're gonna need to proceed to San Vicente, east of the Miracle Mile District.
Nearest cross street is Sixth.
BOBBY: Copy that.
He's ready.
I know, honey, I know.
He wants out!
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Where the hell have you guys been?
We are fighting a system outage, sir.
We apologize for the delay. Hen, you're up.
Eddie, start fluids.
(stammering) We can't just have the baby here in the lobby.
That's not how this is supposed to happen.
Roger, this is pretty much the way it's happened throughout human his...tory. (groans) Hi. I'm Hen. What's your name?
(panting): Sonia. 39 weeks pregnant.
38 years old, which makes me a geriatric pregnancy.
God, I hate that word.
Word doesn't matter.
You're still gonna get a baby out of it.
I can't believe I'm finally gonna meet him. Here.
In the lobby. (laughs) That's all right. You're doing great, okay?
Now, on this next contraction, we're gonna push, okay, Sonia?
(groaning) Sonia? Sonia?
There's something wrong with the baby.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Your baby's fine.
You'll-you'll be able to see for yourself in just a minute.
No!
No, this was a mistake.
All of it.
Roger was right to panic. Look, we can't do this.
I can't...I can't do this. I shouldn't have this child.
No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Sonia, look at me.
Sonia, look at me, look at me, look at me.
Look at me, look at me.
All you got to do is push.
All you need to do, push.
Push.
(screaming) Good.
Good, good, good. Keep pushing!
Keep pushing!
(screaming continues) Keep pushing!
He's coming! He's coming!
(baby crying) He's here!
He's here!
He's here!
(applause) Yeah. Yes.
Baby's got a set of pipes. (chuckles) We're gonna take you to the warmest place in this lobby, okay? (chuckles) Which is gonna be right here...
BUCK: Hen.
Hen, I got the baby.
Sonia. Sonia?
What's happening? What's happening?
It's okay. Roger, Roger.
What's happening? What?
Roger, Roger. Hey, hey, hey.
Listen, she is in good hands.
Okay? Right now, he needs yours.
Blood pressure went off a cliff.
HEN: Sonia, can you hear me?
Cyanosis.
(baby continues crying) Can someone please tell me what's happening here?
BUCK: Your wife has gone into shock.
I lost her pulse.
HEN: She's in cardiac arrest.
I'm starting compressions.
BOBBY: Okay, let's get her transported to L. A. General now.
Hey, Cap, we're gonna need another ambulance for the baby.
Dispatch, this is Engine 118.
DISPATCH: Stand by, 118.
No more standing by. Guys, let's get her on the gurney. Let's go.
(sirens wailing) (baby crying) BOBBY: Hen, it's been 12 minutes.
Let's switch.
I got it.
Hen, let me take over.
No, I got it.
She's not dying because somebody blew a fuse.
Come on, Sonia. I know you're a fighter.
BOBBY: She is. She was. She was fine when we got there, and then...
Sudden despair and fear and anxiety.
BOBBY: Birth was going like clockwork, even for a geriatric pregnancy.
Then rapid loss of BP.
Amniotic embolism, Cap.
She's hemorrhaging.
The hospital needs to prep for this.
It's a massive transfusion protocol.
BOBBY: Well, we can't radio, but we can still call.
(line ringing) OPERATOR: L. A. General. Operator.
This is Fire Captain Bobby Nash.
I need the ER charge nurse on call.
We've got a patient coming your way.
Rapid transfusion on standby.
Come on, Sonia.
How long has she been down?
Uh, 14...no, 15 minutes.
Okay. Call it.
Come on, Sonia.
Hen.
Come on, Sonia.
Hen.
Hen.
(panting) (monitor flatlining) How is she?
Guys.
What's wrong?
I am so sorry.
You were right.
He's perfect.
I wish you could see him.
I know I was scared and worried that we weren't ready for this, and I am damn sure not ready to do this without you, but I will.
I'm gonna figure it out.
(baby cooing) (baby fusses) (monitor beeping) (baby crying) She's got a pulse.
Go, go! Get her inside!
Let's go.
Watch the left.
Hallway's good.
All right.
(indistinct chatter) Thank you.
(gasping) That was amazing.
That was a miracle.
Right there.
That's not what I'm looking for.
Okay. Uh, right here. Great little Tuscan spot.
Has a garden that's not really a garden, so you still feel like you're sitting outside.
Also, string lights.
Mm, that sounds intimate.
I thought you wanted intimate.
No, I want special.
Rachel McAdams special or Reese Witherspoon special?
I don't think that I know the difference.
Fun and flighty or serious and heartfelt?
No, I don't want serious.
Oh. Then what do you want?
TERRY: I've already run every antivirus protocol we have.
ANDERS: Did you scan for foreign data packets?
Every scan turns up zero.
Well, that's not surprising.
Some of these cyber-thugs can be pretty sophisticated.
Pretty sure, if it were a malware attack, I would have found it by now.
(exhales) (clears throat) Mister...?
Flores, Terry.
Mr. Flores.
I'm sure you're very good at your job.
But this goes beyond tech support.
Now, please.
Let us do what we do.
Sure.
Hey, what's that?
It's electrical fire.
Eleventh and Margo, low-priority call.
Eleventh and Margo.
Okay, let's refuel.
We're back out there in five minutes.
Hen, can you check the ambulance and top off anything that needs resupply?
Copy that, Cap.
Thank you.
(faint chatter) Harry?
Harry.
What're you doing here?
Where's your dad?
We had a fight. He was so mad.
Then I ran away.
He doesn't know you're here?
(softly): Okay.
No, you can't call him.
Harry, your dad's gonna be worried sick about you.
I got to let him know you're okay.
No, you don't understand. He was really mad.
There you are.
How did you find me?
Next time, don't tweet from your secret location.
Get in the car.
Michael, I was gonna call you. We'd just gotten back.
Michael. Michael.
I don't know what you two had a fight about, but Harry seemed real shook up.
Bobby...
do I strike you as the type of man that has fights with his ten-year-old son?
No, I...
Well, then let me fill you in on actually what happened.
Harry was playing with his friend Kyle.
On Kyle's front lawn.
They decided that it would be fun to set a fire and then try to put it out.
Because fighting fires is so cool.
Oh, God. I...Is everybody okay?
Yeah, the kids are fine. The yard, not so much.
But I don't think I need to tell you the ways in which that could have gone horribly wrong.
No, I cannot believe that Harry would do that.
I will talk to him.
You will not.
I'll talk to him. That's my job, not yours.
You've done enough.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Excuse me?
Let me tell you something -- I don't like what's happening to my son.
He used to care about video games and sports and-and comic books.
And ever since you came along, the big damn hero, making him feel like your kind of life is the only one worth having.
Filling his head with reckless ideas.
What we do here is not reckless.
Might be difficult to understand when you've never done the job.
I get it, Bobby.
You're awesome. More awesome than me.
But hear me on this: I am not interested in raising my son in your image.
That is not what I'm doing.
I'm just trying to be there for Harry.
Because I'm not?
I'm only with him half the time now, right?
Maybe that makes me half a father.
It's still half more than you.
GPS VOICE: In .2 miles, turn right.
Then make another right.
That is the fourth right in a row!
The freaking nav is sending me in a circle.
What is going on today?
WOMAN: That's what I'm telling you. 911 is out. Totally gone.
Accidents everywhere. Traffic's going crazy.
Oh, so it's a day that ends in "Y" in L. A.
(gasps) What the...
(explosion) (screams) (tires screech) (horn blaring) (coughing) DAVID: Alex!
Alex!
(car alarms blaring) DWIGHT: This is a live picture from Newscopter Eight.
We're over Doheny Park there, and it's been hit by multiple explosions. Now, we're not sure what's causing these explosions, and we're still waiting for the first responders to arrive at the scene.
We are getting reports from bystanders, though, that some residents were at home...
(line ringing) Yeah, Buck. Where are you guys?
Uh, we are crossing Robertson for the 320th time.
Get over to Doheny Park, man.
The whole damn neighborhood's on fire.
Looks like it's a gas main break.
You heard it on the scanner?
No, I'm watching it on the news right now.
Nobody's over there, Buck.
Not a single unit.
Hey, Cap! Uh, Doheny Park is going up in flames!
Chim thinks it's a gas main break.
We're close, right?
Close enough. Let's do it.
(siren blaring) (indistinct chatter) BOBBY: Dispatch, this is Captain 118.
We're at Doheny Park.
Multiple residential structure fires.
Send everything you can.
JOSH: Copy that, 118.
I'm trying to find additional resources for you, but you might be on your own for the next 15, maybe 20 minutes.
BOBBY: Copy that.
(siren wailing) Help! Help! You got to help!
Cap!
My son! He's trapped upstairs!
Do you know where? Which room?
No, no, I haven't seen him.
Cap, I see him! Upstairs window!
(yells) Sir! Sir! Two!
All right, get the ladder up to the house. Go.
All right.
I'll check the driver, Cap!
Louis.
Go for Louis.
Jones.
Yeah, Cap.
Go door to door. Everyone gets evacuated.
Hen is doing triage.
DAVID: You got to save him!
BOBBY: Sir, just let us work.
Cap!
Yeah?
Hydrant's gone. The only water we got is in the truck.
It's not even enough to put out one house.
Okay.
Keep trying dispatch.
Gas company needs to shut down Doheny Park.
I want a two-mile radius around Lambourne Place.
Two miles.
Copy that.
(sighs) Okay, okay.
Uh...there's no water. They got no backup.
NEWSCASTER: Looks like they hit a pipe. And just thinking ahead...
Backup.
...it could be a huge problem for first responders to deal with when they arrive here at the scene.
(line ringing) That's the only hydrant out there on the street...
MAN: Hello?
Hey, Tommy.
Hey, man.
Yeah, it's me, Howie.
Are you still with the 217?
(screaming, frantic chatter) (coughing) Dad!
I'm over here! Help!
Dad!
BUCK: We got you, big guy.
Help!
I just need you to hold on, okay?
I'm coming for you.
(coughing) Go, go, go!
Almost there.
I told you, everything's gonna be fine.
(metallic grinding) No, no, no!
(grunting) (gasps) Buck!
(grunts) ALEX: Help!
(yells) (whooshing, clattering) You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good. Come on.
Oh, hey, uh, Eddie.
Eddie, what are you doing?
I feel like, if I ever did that, you would yell at me.
WOMAN: Get him out!
(panting) (coughing) (grunting) Alex!
(flame whooshing) (coughing) Alex!
Alex, where are you, buddy?
(coughing) Uh, Cap, I got him. Alive but unconscious.
I'm prepping for evac.
Cap, gas guys just showed up. They're shutting it down.
All neighbors are present and accounted for.
Two more engines are rolling in, but it makes no sense if there's no water pressure.
(explosive booming) (creaking) (grunts) (gasping) Alex!
(grunting) (coughing) (inhales deeply) Cap! Negative on evac.
Pinned down, south side of the house.
I'm gonna take an extinguisher!
If I can make that jump, I can help Eddie!
No, wait.
(airplane engine roaring) Wait, is that...
Incoming! Everybody, take cover!
Under the trucks now! Now! Go, go!
BOBBY: Hunker down. 217 is inbound.
Seriously?
(flame whooshes) (coughs, grunts) BOBBY: Get under the trucks! Under the trucks! Now!
Under, under!
Here!
Hurry! Run, run!
(grunting) Go! Clear, clear, clear!
Hen, Hen, Hen, Hen, Hen! Hen, Hen, Hen!
Stay down!
* (gasping, grunting) Eddie, do you copy?
(sirens approaching) Alex?
(grunting, panting) (Alex coughing) Oh! Oh!
Oh, thank God.
Oh, you're...Hey, buddy.
What's up with the Spider-Man routine?
I don't know. I just did it.
And prayed a lot.
Yeah, it looks like someone was listening.
CHIMNEY: Yes!
You are welcome. You are welcome.
Ow. Ow. (chuckles) REPORTER (on TV): And a C130 supertanker with Cal Fire coming in...
SUE: So, nothing?
Still?
We'll keep digging.
Well, drop the shovel. The system's fine.
MADDIE: The electrical fire -- 11th and Margo, low-priority call -- wasn't so low-priority after all.
Something about the address sounded familiar, so I asked Terry about it.
It's where our communications equipment lives.
The backup generator overheated.
Knocked out the power, took everything offline.
No ransom, no revenge, no terrorism.
It just...
Broke.
Never occurred to us to ask.
(beeping) MAN: Yes!
(others cheer) We're back.
(door opens, closes) Hey, baby.
Do you know what happened to the Andersons' front yard?
Looks like it's burned to a crisp.
You should ask Harry.
I wasn't home when it happened.
Hmm.
Hey, um, I heard 911 was down.
That must have been crazy.
Oh, yeah. It was a trying day.
I don't think I have it in me to cook.
We should order something.
Harry's already on it.
HARRY: Surprise, I'm making dinner for you.
ATHENA: I see.
Waffles. Your favorite.
What did you do?
(cell phone vibrating) I thought you were headed out.
I didn't make a reservation.
We talked about it all day, and I never picked a damn restaurant.
Well, you were a little busy.
Or maybe you're not ready.
(sighs) I just need to leave what happened behind me.
I'm never gonna be able to move forward...
You know, when people break a leg, no one says, "Hey, just walk it off." Because everybody knows that ignoring an injury only compounds the damage.
I'm not ignoring it. I've been talking about it.
And...dealing with it.
But are you letting yourself feel it?
What you've been through is a lot more complicated than a broken bone.
But the advice is the same.
Pretending you're not hurt, it's not the same thing as healing.
BOBBY: There was no warning sign. It just broke.
The worst possible moment.
Eh, budget cuts.
And the way we're going, half the city is gonna be held together with paper clips and duct tape.
Hen thinks it's chewing gum and spit.
(chuckles) Well, I'm afraid that you're gonna be down a ladder for a few days.
And I'll bring in a backup.
But, you know, there's a reason it's a backup.
Paper clips and duct tape?
I could throw in some chewing gum if that'd make you feel better.
Thanks, Marty.
Yeah, well, still, you got it done.
Even with a bum ladder.
That's not nothing.
Equipment breaks, we don't.
Now, that's a T-shirt.
Hope it's not a bad time.
Around here, that changes by the minute.
I thought we should talk.
Sure.
You want some coffee?
There's pie.
I'm sorry.
I was out of line.
I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.
Definitely not in here.
Well, your timing was maybe not ideal.
All right, but listen, if I'm overstepping...
I'm sorry. I will back off.
Because the last thing I want to do is get between a father and his kids.
And I know that, usually.
But today, I overheard Harry bragging about his cool new dad, and I'm not gonna lie, it stung a little.
Look, he's ten. I think that he was just impressed by all the shiny trucks and equipment.
And I think, if you bring him to a job site, show him a crane, you'll be even cooler.
Maybe.
But he was mad at me today, and he ran here, to you.
Well, I don't think it's because he thinks of me as his dad.
I think it's because I'm not.
I'm not the guy who tells him to finish his homework or grounds him because he's done something wrong.
I'm just Best Buddy Bobby, nothing but fun.
(laughs) What?
Really? Is that how you see yourself?
No, no.
It's something that Athena says to me, that I am always trying to win them over, trying to be their friend, not their stepparent.
And she's right.
I am...overcompensating.
For what?
For not being you.
Wow.
Well, I wouldn't get too worked up over that, 'cause I am definitely no fun at all.
I mean, ask Harry or Glenn.
It's just...
I...
We broke up.
Are you sure you don't want a piece of pie?
Uh, maybe.
If there's ice cream.
All right.
You get some ice cream.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about that. It's just...
Athena, she, uh...
she didn't tell me.
Well, Athena doesn't know. Not yet.
I-I've been trying to figure out a way to tell her.
"Remember the time I blew up your life "and left you for somebody else?
Well, whoops." Yeah, that's maybe not the best way in.
For the last three days, I have been feeling like a damn fool, and-and...
and then I started acting like one.
Well, that wasn't my finest moment, either.
You struck a nerve.
The reason that I don't put my foot down with your kids is that I'm always afraid they're gonna tell me that I'm not their father.
Because I'm not.
I'm nobody's father.
But you're about to become a stepfather.
So we have got to work on your bad-cop routine.
Present a united front, all right, or they will divide and conquer us for sure.
All right, deal.
Deal.
Do you need to talk about...
No.
Okay.
Guess maybe next time, I should pick the restaurant, huh?
(laughs) I'm so sorry.
I meant to make a reservation.
That's okay. You had, like, a really crazy first day back, so...
Not as crazy as my first day there, but yeah.
So, I think it's supposed to start raining tomorrow, probably through the weekend.
That'd be nice. (sighs) We could just stay at home and catch up on some sleep.
You're not sleeping okay?
No, I-I am.
All I want to do is sleep.
I just want to pull the covers over my head and-and wait until the world makes sense again.
But I know that I can't do that.
I have to get up and go to work and move forward.
I'm not okay.
Neither of us are.
But I wanted to be. I wanted, uh...
I wanted this date to be perfect to make up for the one we didn't get.
But I think that's asking a little too much of a bowl of pasta. (laughs) I hate my apartment building.
I hate just walking out of my front door.
And I tried coming home, because every time I...
I just see you laying there.
Yesterday, I want to get my mail, and one of my neighbors came up behind me, and I, uh...I'm really not sure which one of us was freaked out more, me or him.
(both laugh) This is never gonna be the same, is it?
Whatever it is that we were about to have, or...
We're never getting it back.
(quietly): No.
I should go.
Hang on a second. Hang on.
We're not saying good-bye.
We just need a minute.
Yeah.
Just a minute.
(door opens, closes)
