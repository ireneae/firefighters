Severely hypotensive and tachycardic.
BP is 67/32. Ma'am, what's your name?
Jules... Patterson.
Okay, Jules Patterson, I'm gonna get you some fluids, and get you something for the pain, okay?
Now I want you to breathe and try to stay with me, okay?
Why... were they carrying signs?
Okay, Jules, your pulse and this entry wound are telling me it has not damaged your heart. You're very lucky.
Don't... feel lucky.
It's deep enough to have hit her aorta.
We can't travel her with this.
Edge is too sharp. It'll do more damage on the drive.
Aorta is nicked and we pull it out...
I'd bleed out on the street, drivers win.
Backboard's here.
Jules, we got you.
Buck, get a C-collar on her.
Okay, we pull the sign, pack the wound, rig a makeshift junctional tourniquet, keep the pressure on.
I got a better way.
Lucy, grab the REBOA kit out of that bag and open it up for me, please.
We got REBOA kits now?
You know how to use 'em?
You sound shocked.
That's what happens when you disappear for six months.
Your colleagues get trained in all kinds of stuff.
Touché.
Let's do it. Okay, Jules, I'm gonna pull the sign out of you while my brilliant colleague completely upstages me by threading a tiny balloon in your femoral artery.
We're gonna blow it up and create what we call an "occlusion." It's gonna stabilize your blood pressure.
Oh, and keep you alive.

Well, danger is her middle name.

Could have been a city truck, but without a plate, it'll be tricky to find.
Yeah, well, truck's not the only thing with a plate.

You know I've been talking to Frank, right?

I thought you'd feel better after talking to him.
Yeah.
Sometimes it's hard. Frank asks a lot of questions.
And you know, talking about things that are scary or sad can be... exhausting.
I guess.
But it's still a good thing to do, so I'm gonna keep talking to Frank, and eventually I will feel better.
The things that make you sad, am I one of them?
Never.
(Jee-Yun crying) I know.
Good evening, Ms. Buckley.
Good to see you.
Thank you for seeing us so late.
How are you doing, young lady?
You know what, she's really tired today.
She didn't eat much, and then I noticed she was running a fever.
Any bowel movements?
One this morning, but not since.
Shh. It's okay.
Definitely a fever.
Okay. It's okay.
Let's check the belly, okay?
(crying continues) Sweetheart, it's all right.
He just wants to make sure you're okay.
We need to get her into the emergency room right now.
What?
Uh, I'm looking for Han. First name...
Howie.
Hey, what happened?
The doctor thinks it's intussusception.
They're running tests now to confirm, see if her intestines are blocked, and if so, how serious it is.
Okay.
Okay, any theories on an underlying cause?
Viral infection. She's too young for appendicitis.
Okay, uh, could be autoimmune, Celiac, Crohn's.
A tumor. I mean, it's a possibility, right?
"None of the above" is also one of the possibilities, okay?
Sometimes kids just get intussusception.
No one knows why. Might be a family history.
Yeah, leukemia. That's in my family history.
<i> (screaming)</i> <i> ERIC: Oh, my God!</i> <i> (excited chatter on video)</i> Any word from Chimney or your sister?
Uh, no. Still just waiting on updates.
Hey, uh, awesome catch.
Mm.
But-- and I say this with some experience here-- maybe don't let it go to your head.
It's not.
(scoffs) She should have died.
Nine times out of ten, I don't catch her.
Or I don't see her in time, I don't move fast enough.
Or I grab her and she slips through, and she takes me with her.
Wait, you're obsessing over things that didn't happen?
I'm trying to figure out how I should have saved her in a way that doesn't involve luck. (sighs) So I'm ready for next time.
My first year here, there was this guy hanging from a roller coaster.
I didn't get to him in time, and he fell.
Yeah, I remember that.
I spent a lot of time running that one back in my mind, you know.
What if I had got to him faster?
What if the truck had been at a better angle?
What if he had just grabbed my damn hand?
You have any epiphanies?
That it didn't matter what brilliant hypothetical scenario I could come up with.
He was still gonna be dead.
That lady... she didn't die, 'cause you caught her.
So accept it was a lucky break and move on?
Look, your luck could change tomorrow, so we take the wins when we can get 'em.
(alarm ringing) <i> MAN (over P. A.): Attention,</i> <i> Station 118...</i> Anyway, luck or not, that was still a great save.
(sighs heavily) Stop what you're doing.
I'm not doing anything.
Just waiting.
Shouldn't we know something by now?
I'm gonna go ask someone.
(exhales sharply) Maddie, this isn't your fault.
We don't know what it is.
Whatever it is, it's not your fault.
Even if it turns out to be the same, exact rare form of leukemia that your brother had, it wouldn't be your fault.
I just keep thinking is it reckless or selfish to have a baby with that family history?
Well, your parents had three kids.
Two of 'em grew up to be perfectly healthy.
One didn't, but that was 30 years ago, and the field of medicine has come a long way since then.
Hell, there wasn't even a bone marrow database back then.
I can't be the reason that she's in danger again.
You're not. You never were.
Last time it was an accident. This time...
we don't even know what it is yet.
Yeah.
I slammed a car door on her hand.
We were somewhere around Toledo, and we had stopped for the night, and I had unbuckled her from her car seat, but I realized she needed a warmer jacket, so I was gonna go to the back to grab one for her.
(sighs) I didn't realize she climbed out of her car seat, and I shut the door, and her hand was there.
Oh, my God.
And she screamed bloody murder, and I thought that I had maimed her for life.
But I didn't.
How long did you beat yourself up for that?
(scoffs) I'll let you know when I stop.
By the time I saw the RPG coming, it was too late.
We got hit, and we went down.
You said Mills was the first one to see it.
Did you both have the same vantage point at the time?
Uh, no. She was in the front. I was sitting behind her.
Did you have a clearer view out the window than Mills did?
Not really. I kind of had my hands full working on Greggs.
Okay, let me see if I understand.
Mills had a better view of the ground down below, and you couldn't really look out the window because you were trying to save an injured man's life.
Not that it mattered. He died anyway.
You regret trying to save him?
What? No.
I only ask because when you talk about the chopper being shot down, you imply that you could have done something to stop it.
From what you've told me, the only way that's possible is if you let Greggs die.
Was that ever an option?
My job was trying to save him. I was doing my job.
So your job wasn't to look for hostiles on the ground?
No.
Then why is it your fault that you didn't see them sooner?
Hey.
Hey. How'd it go?
Usual. Crack myself open for 50 minutes, walk out feeling like I was hit by a bus.
I think that means it's working.
I'm supposed to feel better at some point, right?
Where's Chris?
He's in his room, finishing homework.
Oh.
Chris drew this?
BUCK: That one's mine. I misunderstood the assignment.
Hey, you ever think that maybe it's not worth it?
Not the therapy, the...
What we do for a living that makes us need therapy.
What I put myself through, what I put my kid through.
The greater good and all.
Maybe that's not a thing.
Maybe it's just random.
If that's the case, then what's the point of it all?
<i> TV REPORTER:</i> <i> In case you missed it,</i> <i> stunning footage</i> <i> from the scene of</i> <i> an incredible rescue</i> <i> as a woman falling</i> <i> from a sign...</i> No matter how many times I see it, it still doesn't seem real.
Oh, tell me about it. I was standing right next to her, and I'm still not sure how she did it.
It's enough to make you believe in actual miracles.
(door opens) Maddie.
Buckley-Han?
Yeah, that's us.
Okay. I've got good news and great news.
Well, we like how you're starting.
It was intussusception, which we confirmed with a lower GI series that very helpfully put her intestine back where it belonged.
It happens sometimes.
But that means we don't have to repair it surgically.
Uh, what about the underlying cause?
Anything to worry about there?
Clean bill of health.
Okay, so when can we see her?
They'll be bringing her up soon.
Just want to keep an eye on her for a few hours, see if there's any adverse reaction to the barium.
Then you can take her home.
Thanks. Thanks so much.
Well, Mom should get a thank-you, too.
If we hadn't caught this so early, we might not be so lucky.
It was a good call bringing her in.
Man, we'd be done by now if we hadn't lost that stop sign.

Uh, you mean she's not taking reporters' calls, right?
Exactly. So...
I was thinking maybe you could talk to her and put in a good word for me.
No. Absolutely not.
Oh...
Never gonna happen, but-but-but, hey, hey, I will give you an exclusive and pretty heartwarming surprise ending to the story that no one else knows.
Oh, I'm intrigued. What's the catch?
I need you to help me find someone.
(horse snorts) BUCK: Hey, so, uh, so what do you think?
They're really tall.
(Buck laughs) If you don't want to do this or it gets too scary, we can leave.
When do I get to ride one?
Okay, maybe not that scary.
First, I am gonna introduce you to all the horses, and then I'm gonna show you how to groom them and feed them, and then you're gonna walk around on a lead.
That sounds like work.
(Buck chuckles) Yeah. Yeah, it's work.
But it's how the horses learn to trust you, and you learn to trust the horses.
Can I show him around the place?
Sure.
I'll be here if you need me, okay?
Okay.
All right.
Ready?
Let's go meet some horses.
Have fun.
Okay, Dad. Thanks.
(speaking quietly) Equine therapy?
I was doing some research with Taylor, and I found this place.
What kind of research?
Well, you were saying the other day how random everything seems.
Like, is there, is there a point to anything?
I remember.
So before you joined the 118, right, we had this rule.
Don't go past the glass doors.
We bring someone to the ER, we hand them over, and that's it-- our job is done.
Never heard that one.
I'm not sure who the first one to break the rule was.
Probably me.
Yeah.
Our job was always just to save the person in front of us.
Whatever happens next, well, we...
we aren't supposed to know.
I can see the wisdom in that philosophy.
It got me thinking...
about the day you got shot.
Well, with everything that happened, I almost forgot, that wasn't even our call.
We were only there because of...
Charlie.
It made me wonder if you ever wished we hadn't saved him.
What?
Come on.
The kid is being poisoned by his mom.
Probably gonna be messed up for life.
He almost died. You don't regret going there?
No.
But if it's all just random...
It was still the right thing to do.
Yeah.
I think so, too.
That's Charlie.
BUCK: He lives with his aunt and uncle now.
They seem like really good people.
They've been bringing him here for the past few months.
He looks happy.
BUCK: 'Cause he got the help he needed.
And that started with you.
Whatever happens to him next, you gave him that second chance.
Maybe that's the point.
Yeah. (chuckles) Maybe it is.
