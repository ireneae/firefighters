<strong>Jerome</strong>: Maybe they'll put a catheter in me at the hospital, and then I'll be able to go to the bathroom any time I damn well please.
Jerome is joking about wanting a catheter, Hen.
I think he may have a head injury.
Tell him to hold on.
Almost there, buddy.

<strong>Evelyn</strong>: Hey, let me give you a preview of tonight, Gram.
I know you'll love it.
(<em>Laughs</em>) Gotta say, I feel completely vindicated backing your decision to quit the piano at age nine.
It is so fun telling your parents, &quot;I told you so.&quot;
I'd take all the credit, but I know you were the OG, Gran.
I hate that I can't be there for your Philharmonic debut.
