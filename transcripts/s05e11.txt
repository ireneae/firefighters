Hey.
The country club said the building's been vacant for repairs.
That's why nobody heard him hit the roof.
Do you know when this happened?
No.
I saw a crew up there this morning.
So, no more than a few hours. All right.
Keep everybody back.
(<em>speaks Spanish</em>)
Got your med kit?
Not my first rodeo.
<em>Mija,</em> this is terrible. The party's ruined.
Are you kidding, Mom?
This is awesome.
<strong>Judith</strong>: Really?
Jonah, Hen, you take the roof.
Buck, we're gonna come at him on the inside.
Ericson, you're up top on the assist.
All right. Up we go, Monday.
Name's Jonah, and you know that.
Why do you keep calling me Monday?
'Cause there's a new one of you every shift.
To me, you're Monday.
He went clear through the roof.
Sir? Sir? Can you hear me?
(<em>groaning</em>)
I got a pulse.
Please... help me.
Easy. Don't move. You don't want to exacerbate your injuries.
What's your name?
Lenny.
<strong>Jonah</strong>: Paragliding? What happened?
<strong>Lenny</strong>: Wind picked up. Tried to avoid some... power lines and lost control.
Pulse is 130. BP's 105/60.
Breathing is fast, but his lungs sound clear.
<strong>Jonah</strong>: Opening a line.
Pushing ten of morphine.
Hang in there, Lenny. I'm giving you some of the good stuff.
Pretty soon, you won't feel a thing.
Already can't feel my legs.
Lenny, can you wiggle your fingers for me.
How about this? Can-can you feel that? Okay.
Yeah.
<strong>Jonah</strong>: Lumbar injury?
Spinal compression?
<strong>Hen</strong>: Possibly.
What if my legs are completely gone?
Don't worry. Don't think you'd be talking to us at all.
We'll have a visual soon enough, okay? Cap.
How we looking down there?
Almost in position.
Uh, hey, Cap, I don't want to be insensitive, but, uh, do his legs look really short?
Oh...
Hen, Jonah, get down here right now.
<strong>Hen</strong>: Bilateral open knee dislocation.
The impact forced the femurs down through the knee.
Landed on his feet, and his upper legs kept going.
Thinking it's better now that he can't feel them.
Blood loss isn't that bad, considering.
Lucky he didn't sever his femoral arteries.
Do we reset them here?
<strong>Hen</strong>: Absolutely not.
You know better than to attempt that out in the field.
I heard you like to push the envelope.
Something about having your hand inside of a guy's torso for two hours?
That's an entirely different envelope. Grab the splints.
<em>Ready for extraction, Cap.</em>
All right, Lenny, you stay calm.
Things are gonna get a little noisy.

<strong>Bobby</strong>: Hey.
Hey.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Ooh, something smells good.
Ah, it should be ready soon. How'd it go?
Well, not too bad for me.
The 153 is the target of choice this time around.
<strong>Harry</strong>: I don't understand why they make you go to those meetings. Don't you write down everything that happens while you're at work?
Well, they like to ask follow-up questions like, &quot;Why did it take you nine minutes to respond to that call?&quot;
Or, &quot;Why'd you stay at the scene so long?&quot;
Or, &quot;Why have you still not filled those empty slots in your company roster?&quot;
<strong>Harry</strong>: Sounds like your bosses get you all dressed up to meet up with you so they can tell you that you suck.
Pretty much.
You do those, too, Mom?
No. For which I am grateful because I have seen grown men throwing up in trash cans after coming out of some of those CompStat meetings.
Personnel files?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Yeah.
Candidates to fill Chimney and Eddie's slots. Turns out I've put it off for as long as I can.
Well, you know the rules.
No homework at the table.
Well, I have to change anyways, so I'll just put them in the bedroom and read them later.
Well, so much for a relaxing bedtime.

<em>Before you do, take a look in your armrest. You work in computers, Sasha. You must recognize a smartphone circuit board. Its sensors can tell what speed you're going. Drop below 55, the bomb... explodes.</em>
Okay. Why do you think that?
<strong>Sasha</strong>: A guy just called, he said if we slow under 55, that we're gonna explode.
Sir, I've seen that movie.
It's a crime to make a false 911 call.
<strong>Sasha</strong>: <em>No, it's not a fake call.</em>
Okay? Please don't hang up.
<em>He told us to look in the armrest. There's all kinds of circuitry in there.</em>
He-he knew things about us, where we live.
Look, I don't know if this is <em>a prank or not, but I don't want</em> my wife and kids to die finding out.
Okay. I believe you.
Where are you driving right now?
W-We're headed west on the 210.
We just passed Sunland.
<em>Okay, just keep calm,</em> and keep driving safely. CHP is gonna perform a traffic break to clear the road, and I'm sending help to you now.

It's okay.
They're just gonna help us get off.

<strong>Sasha</strong>: It's okay, guys.
We just have to listen to them.
Okay? We're gonna be fine.
<strong>Erica</strong>: Dad and I are right here, okay?
<strong>Jim</strong>: All right, I'm deploying the drone to check for devices.
Homemade device.
Could be packed with a nitrate, or a chloride compound. Any one of those <em>would take out the truck and then some.</em>

<em>What is it? Is it real?</em>
Okay, hold on. I'm connecting the police to this call now.

Do you defuse it?
We can't do anything <em>while you're moving.</em>
What do we do, then?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: <em>Step one, we're gonna ride alongside that pickup truck and match its speed.</em>
We have to move fast, so the 147 is here to assist.
<em>Buck, once we're in position, I want you to jump</em> into that truck bed.
Ravi is here to give a hand.
<em>Somebody from the 147 will do the same.</em>

Linda, tell them not to take the driver out of the truck.
Why not?
Give me your earpiece.
Put me through to the rescue team.
Guys. Guys, it's Eddie.
<em>Do not move the driver. A bomb like that is a sophisticated device.</em>
There could be a pressure switch somewhere that senses the driver's movements.
Let me talk to the driver. Sir, I need you to check around your seat, <em>under the gas pedal.</em>
Look for wires or anything that looks or feels <em>out of place.</em>
I-I see something.
Under the gas pedal, like <em>a metal bar with springs. What is it? What do I do?</em>
It's called a pressure switch.
<em>Do not</em> take your foot off the gas.
<em>Okay, everything's gonna be fine.</em>
Just sit tight.
<strong>Buck</strong>: <em>Uh, yeah, problem with that plan.</em>
We don't have a lot of freeway left.
(<em>grunting</em>)
So what's the move?
<strong>Jim</strong>: <em>Dad, for now, you stay in the truck. Mom</em> and everyone else off.
<em>We keep you moving, load two of my guys, and we defuse it in motion.</em>
We're switching seats.
What?!
I put my foot on the gas first. You slide underneath me.
I stay, you go.
No. Have you lost your mind?
Sasha, I've run all the versions.
You live, I go.
The boys have their dad, okay?
We both die, your parents take them.
Your mother may be horrible to me, but she adores those children.
The version I can't live with is you gone and me hearing your mother teaching them to hate me because I let you die.
<strong>Athena</strong>: <em>Ma'am,</em> it may not be my place, but we're a little short on time here.
You don't know her.
I think I have a pretty good idea.
<strong>Erica</strong>: <em>You have</em> a horrible mother-in-law too?
<strong>Athena</strong>: <em>I have a mother who matches her description. She hated my husband. But eventually,</em> she warmed up to him.
How?
He asked her for help.
<em>Made her feel needed.</em>

Honey, I'll be right behind you.

Okay, I'm gonna stick this around your waist, okay?
Just keep yourself nice and low.

Okay, okay. Ready?
Yeah.

Nope.

He won't clean it up.
It's not crap. It's my property.
Every morning I look out my window, and this is my view.
It's unsanitary and it's unsightly.
Those words are subjective, right?
(<em>laughs</em>) Oh.
Huh. That family just listed way below comps to get away from this creep's junkyard.
That's not subjective. He's hurting my wallet.
So far, what I'm hearing is a complaint to the city, not a reason to call 911.
They didn't call. I did. Okay, these people are trespassing.
They've been stealing my property.
They are harassing me.
Your property?
You fished half this junk out of our trash!
No! Oh! (<em>gasps</em>)
It's only junk if it's not useful, which all of this is.
Okay, do you have any idea how hard it is to find diodes like these?
Oh, I'll put 'em somewhere you'll be able to find 'em!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.
Hey.
<strong>Athena</strong>: All right, all right. Enough.
Get back.
Both of you, to your corners.
I'm watching you.
Oh, is that a threat? He threatened me. That's right.
All right, we...
You heard him.
He threatened me.
We have plenty of room in the back of that car for the both of you.
I...
Williams, start taking statements.
I'll be right back.
What? No. Where are you...?
Where's she going?
<strong>Williams</strong>: She'll be back.
Just stay right there.
Sergeant Grant.
I heard you're moving in a hurry.
Is that because of the car bomber?
That man knew where we lived. He's still out there.
We'll just feel safer someplace else.
Even if it is at my mother-in-law's.
Oh. On her invitation?
I took your advice.
All I needed to do was just reach out and ask her for help, and... now she loves me.
You're here for Trashcan Kurt?
Well, he doesn't seems to be too well-liked around these parts.
We have tried. We've even offered to clean up, but he just refuses.
My husband even filed for a court order to force him to clean up.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Oh, yeah? How'd that go?
We didn't even make it to court. I just...
With everything that's gone on, it's...
It just didn't feel important anymore.
So you dropped the court order?
The man who called you about the bomb...
You said he knew things about you.
Yeah. He said he knew our kids' names, what my husband did for a living.
It was like he was watching us the whole time.
Like he was right outside your house, looking in?
<strong>Erica</strong>: That's what he said... &quot;I'm watching you.&quot;
Go inside and lock all the doors, now.
This is 727-L-30 requesting immediate backup at 573 Dunham Lane.
Possible bombing suspect. Pursuing him into his home.
You two! Get inside. Williams, go around back, keep an eye out for trip wires.
Who knows what he's got cooked up in there.
Everyone, back in your homes!
Sir!
This is the LAPD. If you do not open this door, we are coming in.
(<em>sighs</em>)
(<em>gasps</em>)
(<em>rat squeaking</em>)
(<em>grunts</em>)
(<em>grunts</em>)
Dispatch, this is 727-L-30.
We need a RA unit. He may have sustained minor injuries.
Bomber suspect is in custody.
(<em>doorbell rings</em>)
Eddie.
Hey, Bobby.
Sorry for showing up out of the blue.
I wanted to talk to you before you started your shift.
Always happy to see you. Come on in.
All right. What did you want to talk about?
My request to transfer back to the 118.
Okay, what's going on?
Nothing. I realized I made a mistake, and I want to fix that.
I'm ready to come home.
We talked about this before you left.
(<em>laughs</em>) I know, I know.
You tried to talk me out of it. Uh, you were right.
It isn't about being right, Eddie.
I just want to understand what's changed.
It wasn't three months ago you asked to transfer out, now you want back in.
Christopher was struggling.
He wasn't the only one.
You said that.
I agreed to a transfer, we found you a spot at dispatch, but you don't seem better.
Are you sleeping at all?
(<em>sighs</em>) It's been a rough few months.
I don't think I... gelled there, yeah.
I remember when I first went on medical leave.
It was like all the noise outside stopped, but the noise inside my head got louder.
I think, sometimes, the life we lead, the hours we keep, our focus on other's well-being...
We wind up ignoring our own.
That's not what's happening here.
I... I'll be fine.
Once I'm back on the job.
I think that might need to wait a little while.
You're saying no?
Is this punishment for leaving?
No.
This is concern. I'm not saying never.
But for your sake and the sake of the team, I can't have you back the way you are right now.
You need to go talk to someone, work out whatever's going on.
I don't need a mental health check.
Just need my job back.
You've known me long enough to know those things go hand in hand.
I can go to another house.
Well, you better hope they don't call me for a recommendation.
(<em>sighs</em>) You know, when the brass was coming for you, when they were trying to fire you, I had your back.
I supported you, and now you're trying to turn on me?
Eddie, that's not what's going on here.
I'm looking out for you.
You're gonna stand there with a hundred-something bodies on you and tell me I'm not fit for duty?
Go to hell, Bobby.
(<em>door opens</em>)
(<em>door closes</em>)
(<em>Taylor humming</em>)
Uh, hey.
Hey.
Can we talk?
Okay. Yeah.
Just, um, give me one minute.
It's, uh, it's-it's important.
Okay.
Everything all right?
You look like you're about to throw up.
Oh.
Uh, um... th-things have-have been great with us.
Or real-really great.
Uh, this is easily the most functional relationship I-I've ever been in.
Well, careful with the sweet talk.
It might go to my head.
I-I just... I-I want to say that I-I love you.
And-and I do, and I-I would never intentionally do anything to hurt you.
Spit it out, Buckley.
Uh...
I-I think-I think you should move in with me.
(<em>laughs</em>)
<strong>Hen</strong>: <em>You did</em> what?!
I know, okay? I-I... I panicked.
I was gonna tell her, but she looked so... pre-hurt.
I had to say something else.
And what did she say?
Well, she was surprised, and, uh... and then, she-she said yes.
And now the two of you are living together?
Well, not for a few weeks.
Uh, she-she's got to pack and get out of her lease.
Are you familiar with the term &quot;out of the frying pan and into the fire&quot;?
Come on. It's-it's gonna be fine, all right?
Taylor and I already spend all our time together.
What's the difference?
Buck, a relationship changes when suddenly neither of you has your own place to run to, especially when there's something you're running from.
I'm not running from anything, okay?
I... I love Taylor.
And Lucy?
I don't ever have to see her again.
Everybody upstairs. Rundown in five.
I've got some announcements to make.
<strong>Ravi</strong>: Hey, what was the deal with Eddie at the bar the other night?
He was there? I didn't see him.
I texted him. I just... I thought he was a no-show.
Well, I saw him in the parking lot, and he just kind of blew me off.
Weird.
Yeah.
Wonder what's going on.
Why do I get the feeling that man is one of the announcements?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Morning, everyone. As you all know, we've been two people light these last few months.
We've had some great people fill in, but I think it's time to stop the revolving door.
You all know Jonah. He's been with us for a few shifts. He's done an excellent job.
And he'll be our new paramedic.
(<em>quietly</em>): Damn it.
<strong>Jonah</strong>: Thanks, Captain.
I'm really happy to be here and be a part of the team.
Doesn't seem so bad.
He'll probably be a good partner.
What are you doing right now?
<strong>Buck</strong>: I-I'm looking on the bright side, trying to be a better Buck.
Well, stop it.
Who's gonna be the other one?
Someone you also know, just not as well.
