("Trapped" by Bruce Springsteen playing) ABBY: People are resilient.
I think we're designed that way.
It's embedded in our DNA to forge ahead, soldier on.
It's a whole lot easier to do with an army at your back.
OFFICER : Got to keep moving, brother.
Can't sleep here. Keep moving.
ABBY: But sometimes it feels like we're on our own.
* It seems like I'm caught up in your trap again... * It might even feel like the world is conspiring against us at times.
A test to see just how much we can take.
How do you get out? How do you break the cycle?
* Well, now I'm trapped * Ooh, yeah * I'm trapped.
Oh, no!
Wait!
No! No!
What's this dude's problem?
Seriously We're gonna have to get in front of him.
Okay.
You got a guy trapped inside, inside the compactor.
That's impossible.
He dialed 911 from inside.
No, I mean that's not possible.
We haven't picked any garbage up yet.
Wait, what?
You got the wrong truck, man. She's empty.
It's the wrong truck.
Um, thank you. Carry on. Y-You're doing a great job.
Dispatch, this is T-118. We are at Chandler and Allott.
We have the wrong garbage truck.
Do you have a location for the garbage truck?
ATHENA: This is 727-L-30.
I got eyes on your garbage truck.
Corner of Ventura and Stern. Search and Rescue on the way.
That's, like, two blocks away.
Let's go.
All right.
MAN: Help!
Turn it off!
Help!
Turn off the compactor now!
Turn off the compactor!
Help!
There's someone inside. !
The Dumpster. He was asleep.
How was I supposed to know he was sleeping in one of the Dumpsters?
You're not in any trouble.
Yeah.
What kind of pressure does it operate under?
I don't know. 2,000 PSI That would crush a car.
GARBAGEMAN: Damn. Look at her go.
Hello Can you hear us?
Ooh, this stinks.
People call us heroes?
BUCK: Oh, Hen, hold up.
It's gonna take forever by hand.
Hey, Chim, can you grab shovels?
Come on, what are you, scared to get your hands dirty, Buck?
Come on, let's go!
I don't know.
But if I were you, I'd stay out of her way.
CHIMNEY: I'm coming in.
You got that.
GARBAGEMAN: Wait, so, he was, uh, he was sleeping in a Dumpster, They give them to the homeless.
It's part of the Lifeline program.
Keeps them connected to family, if they have any.
I got him. I see a foot!
I got it.
I got a pulse.
Stay still, sir. Do not move your neck.
Chim, get me a neck brace and a board in here.
We got to get him out of here.
I don't understand.
How'd he survive that kind of pressure?
Probably fell into this pocket here.
He got protected by the chair.
Sir, can you hear me?
Can you hear me? Does it hurt when you breathe?
It hurts.
I can't feel my legs.
We're gonna get you out of there.
You're gonna be all right, okay?
Sam.
You're gonna be all right, Sam.
ABBY: So, Carla, it's your last chance to tell me if you're not up for working extra hours.
When have you ever known me not to speak my mind?
Very true.
Well, I appreciate it.
Mm-hmm.
Buck and I are both working the graveyard shift, and then he has a little breakfast date planned for us.
Ooh.
And considering our last proper date was scheduled when you and I : were in the E. R. with her.
Uh-huh.
Well, have fun, all right. I could use the overtime.
Okay, good. Good.
Hope this date is him having you rub baby oil on his biceps.
Okay, Mom.
I got to go to work.
Stay.
Mom.
Stay, please.
I know. I wish I could.
Stay. Stay.
Please.
It's okay. I'll see you in the morning, okay?
Are you okay?
Come on. Come on.
Oh, my God.
Do you... do you need some ice?
I'm good. I mean...
She's getting worse.
Maybe it...
This could be another episode.
Oh, God.
It's okay.
I should stay. I'm not...
No. No.
No, no, no. Get out of here.
No, I mean, this is...
Go to work. Go to your date. Go be young while you still are.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah. Okay.
Oh, my God.
I didn't ask you to lunch just so I can buy you a hot dog you won't eat.
Talk to me.
Is this about Karen? Did you tell her?
I didn't have to.
She already knew.
And she presented me with papers.
Custody.
My ex is suing us for custody.
On what grounds?
'Cause she's the birth mother.
And that she gave up the baby under duress.
Does she have a chance?
Well, I read about a case in Michigan where they took a five-year-old little boy away from the only family he ever knew and gave him to his birth father.
I mean, her chances are slim, but they're not zero.
And now she's saying that...
that Denny's living in an unstable home because...
because I stepped out on my wife.
With the same damn woman who's suing you for custody?
All I know is that I just feel like...
covering myself in all that garbage we just dug through and letting the compactor just squish me into nothing.
You gonna get through this.
And I'm here to help.
I mean, if you need the number of a good lawyer...
Divorce or custody?
Between my wife and my ex, I don't know who I'm-a face in court first.
You know, my recommendation for you will be make divorce the last option.
It's hard work, especially if you have kids.
You and Michael-- y'all gonna get a divorce?
It's time.
I mean, I'm not sad about...
I am, but I know it's the right thing.
Mm-hmm.
And I feel excited about the future, you know, about not feeling so confused all the time.
You finding anyone new?
Dang, girl, already?
What Get out of here with that.
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
I'm still trapped in my past.
You just got free. You gonna tell me about this.
The other night, I met a guy at a bar.
Wow.
Athena Grant let a stranger pick her up and take her home?
Oh, I did a background check. Yeah, no.
My plan wasn't to go home with him, but he was just...
Needed to feel like a woman.
Mm.
I left there thinking that, you know...
that's a one-hit wonder.
Guess I made an impression.
Tomorrow right after my shift.
Oh!
We're late. Again.
Dr. Franks doesn't care.
Because Dr. Franks gets to charge us for the whole session, no matter how much of it we miss.
Maybe it's not worth it, okay?
I don't think Dr. Franks is really doing any good.
Because you are not trying.
To grow up. To be an adult.
You're 18, not eight. You don't have a job.
You are not in school.
You flunked out after one semester-- which, honestly, I did not even realize was possible-- because you did not try. You never try.
So I haven't figured out yet what I want to do with my life.
Okay, does that...
Do you think that I really want to spend 80 hours a week hawking luxury lofts and million No, I really don't.
Ow!
Mom?
M Mom! Mom, are you okay?!
All the cars are locked down.
Car three was headed up to 14, and somewhere around eight, damn thing just started dropping like a rock.
Dispatch says two: a mother and her teenage son. The mother's hurt.
BOBBY: Where's the car now?
DAVIS: Halfway below basement level.
That's the other problem.
Since this morning.
Third one this month. Pipes in this place are ancient.
Every time the construction guys go near them, they burst.
And did you replace the elevator cables afterwards?
The water corrodes them.
We were gonna do that after we took care of the flooding issue.
We're gonna have to go in from above.
Buck and I should just go down with the basket.
I'll get the winch.
I'll lock and tag out the power of the cars.
This way.
TODD: Mom, the water's getting higher.
MARJORIE: Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Come on.
No, you're doing fine.
No, I mean, we're only here because of me.
: Dad left... because of me.
Oh, no.
You're right, okay? I'm a screwup.
I-I am, and I'm sorry.
No.
I'm sorry.
Listen to me. That is not why your father left.
Your father left...
because he got bored.
Of me and our life and anything resembling responsibility.
Is that why you're so mad at me?
Because I'm like him?
You're nothing like him.
You take after me.
Okay.
And that's why I push you so hard.
Listen to me.
Okay.
Because I know... you can be so much more.
CHIMNEY: Pressure line's ready, Cap.
All right, let's go.
All right, that's good.
Honey. Honey. Honey.
Uh-huh. Wait. Right here.
Hello!
TODD: Thank goodness.
BUCK: Be right there, guys.
Watch yourselves.
MARJORIE: Thank you.
Rope coming in.
Oh, my... Hi.
Hey, guys.
My son is, is right behind me, yes?
Yes.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Okay.
Don't even worry about it, okay? I'll be right there.
HEN: Okay, Bobby.
All right, we're gonna bring her up. Go ahead, Chim.
BOBBY: Come right through here.
Just come right through here.
All right, that's one.
Thank you.
You're next. Okay, let's do this.
All right.
BUCK: Uh, hey, uh, Bobby, um, need another harness.
Coming down.
Oh.
Hey, the-the weight of the water is pulling us down.
BOBBY: All right, grab the kid, get the hell out of there.
Yeah, but we both won't fit.
I need another harness.
We can only do one at a time, Cap.
I don't suppose you do a lot of pull What?
That's what I thought. Okay.
Pull it up.
All right, let's freewheel it. Come on.
Okay, ready?
We got you, we got you.
All right... all right.
Buck! Buck!
Buck!
Mom?
Hey. Hey.
Is she gonna be all right?
They'll check her out more at the hospital.
It just seems like a mild concussion.
You'll just have to keep an eye on her for the next few days.
We could have died like that.
Trapped together, full of anger and resentment.
I don't want that.
But we didn't.
They got us out. We're free, Mom.
No.
I don't mean today.
I mean 20, 30 years together, stuck with each other until I draw my last breath.
You need to move out.
But I don't have a job, Ma. I...
You will find one.
You proved today that you are not a helpless idiot.
Okay.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You keep on that uniform.
Hmm?
It's a hot day in July.
One of those hundred-degree So Cal days.
You spot me on La Brea.
I'm driving 90 in a 45.
You hit the siren, pull me over, and walk over to my window, where you lower yourself down.
You make eye contact.
It is so hot that you unbutton your shirt.
Are you serious?
Have you been smoking something?
Athena, seeing a woman as beautiful as you in a police uniform, it's... mmm.
I'm a strong man.
I run an entire department.
50 people all answering to me.
I'm in control.
So what could be more sexy to me...
... than a woman strong enough to take that control away from me?
Mmm.
Mm, well, I've never done anything like that before.
At least not in the bedroom.
Mm, mm, mm.
Sir.
Ooh.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to place you under arrest.
On what charges?
Being so damn fine.
Might want to restrain me, Sergeant.
I've been a bad, bad boy.
Ooh.
Don't you want to read me my rights?
Ooh, you have the right to be as loud as you like.
Mmm...
!
You just handcuffed both of us to the bed.
I thought you were into it.
I was. But the key to the cuffs is in my belt, on the floor!
AARON: Oh.
Damn.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Okay.
Maybe you can go over...
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Just wait a minute.
Okay.
Oh. No.
No, no. It's... Won't move.
Hold up, wait.
Oh! Okay, wait, wait.
Okay. I have a friend.
He's two houses down. I'll-I'll just give him a call.
Oh, no. No, no, no. Uh-uh. No, you won't.
Nobody's coming through that door that I don't know.
So how we supposed to get free?
Abby.
Yeah.
Take line two.
They're asking for you.
They're asking for me? Through the system?
Yes. Requested you specifically.
More demanded.
911. This is Abby Clark. What's your emergency?
ATHENA: Hi. Abby, it's Athena. You recognize my voice?
Oh. Yeah, Athena. H Uh, no. Uh, just "Athena." Okay. Uh, Athena, wh Are you on duty?
Uh, this is a personal call.
I, um, seem to have gotten myself in a-a bit of a jam.
I need you to call Henrietta and have her call me back at this number.
Okay. Um, I can do... I don't...
I don't have... Do you have her number?
It's in my phone, which I don't have access to at the moment.
It's okay. I can ask Buck for it.
Oh. Oh, fine.
Don't-don't tell him why you need it.
Okay, I won't. Um...
Are you okay, S... A I'm in no danger of anything, except being embarrassed.
Okay.
'Thena?
ATHENA: Hen!
Hen!
Is that you?
What the... the hell?
Hen, um...
Are you done?
Athena, I thought... I don't know what the hell I thought.
What... You called 911 for this?
911 is the only damn number I have memorized.
Everything else is in my phone, which is over there with my belt and the key.
The key! You need the key?
You called me over here to walk across the room to get you the key AARON: She wouldn't let me call anyone saved in my phone.
And have one of your frat boy friends come over here and catch me like this?
You must be out your mind.
I was never in a frat.
All right, let me... let me... let me just unlock you, then.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
Did I ask you to?
Just put it right there where I can get to it.
Seriously?
Mm-hmm. We good. You can go.
Mm!
M'kay. Well, damn!
Get it, girl.
Let me...
Well, I mean, let me just bring this over here, just in case y'all want to get kinky with the Taser.
Bye, Hen. Wait, let me just...
I just want to get a selfie...
No, no. You really need to go!
* I'm in love with it, intoxicated... * AUTOMATED VOICE: In 0.1 miles, keep right.
* Hi!
Hi.
What the heck is this?
It's our date.
Come on.
Oh, my gosh!
Hi. Hi.
These are for you.
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.
So beautiful.
Whoa!
Uh-huh.
No.
: Oh, my...
Uh, no, but I've answered a few calls from ones that have crashed.
I'm just kidding. It's amazing.
And, uh, there is champagne and truffles on board.
You're surprising me.
Well, you're amazing.
I want to make sure I make you feel that way.
So, today, we fly.
Awesome. Awesome.
Oh, shoot.
Hold on one second. Sorry.
My mom.
Here, let me take these.
Oh, yes. Hold on. Thank you.
CARLA: Hey. I-I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
Okay. All right. She's having another episode.
Car...
Carla, Carla, maybe put her Here, okay, l-listen, listen.
Listen, listen.
There's Abby on the phone.
Mom.
It's Abby. Can you hear me?
She's right here.
PATRICIA: Why are you keeping me prisoner?
CARLA: I think she needs to see your face.
She needs to know you're here.
ABBY: All right.
Carla, I'll-I'll just be there as fast as I can, okay?
Okay.
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry. I have to go.
Uh, hot air balloon.
I know, I know. It's my mom. Sh...
But it's a hot air balloon, you know? You can't just...
reschedule that like a dinner reservation.
I know.
We had a really bad night, and she's just...
just in a terrible place right now.
No, it's fine.
Thank you.
Thanks. I'm sorry.
Bye.
Bye.
You want to give me a lift to work?!
Thought you had the morning off.
Weren't you supposed to be up in a blimp or something?
Hot air balloon. And, uh, she bailed on me.
Uh, her mom wasn't doing well.
That's a bummer. Happens.
Yeah. I don't know.
Look, I'm-I'm super into her.
You know, she is... she's really smart.
And when she makes fun of me, it doesn't make me feel bad.
She has her own money. The sex is... insane.
Oh, here I thought she just had great hair.
: She's the perfect woman.
But this is the second week in a row that my day off has been screwed up because she has to go and deal with her mom.
Well, people who are great tend to have full lives, with people who depend on them.
Yeah. And-and I really like her mom, you know?
I-I do. And I respect the way that Abby takes care of her.
I'm-I'm starting to think maybe...
... maybe this kind of relationship isn't for me.
You mean a real one?
I'm... I mean, I'm 26, right?
You know, I-I want to have fun.
You know? And I'm not saying that I should go and start jumping back into bed with every girl I meet.
I'm-I'm not trying to be that guy anymore.
But maybe I should find something that is a little less...
adult.
Look, all those things that you feel when you're with Abby-- the closeness, intimacy and trust-- those things don't come for free.
Any woman of substance and experience has lived a life, and she's gonna come with some baggage.
I think your problem is you're hoping to pull her out of this trap she's in with her mom.
That's not gonna happen.
What she needs is for you to step inside with her, keep her company in there.
CECIL: What took you so long?
It takes as long as it takes, Cecil.
I'm doing the best I can.
Are-are you sure Yes, I'm sure.
How sure? Winslow. Winslow, how sure?
I'm very sure!
That's good. That's-that's very good.
Circled the block three times. I'm sure.
Did you... did you get the bread, Winslow?
Winslow?
I think my jacket's sn...
Don't... Wins...
Be careful. Don't...
... snagged on something.
Winslow!
Buck, get the saw.
Yes, Cap.
Dispatch said something about the house being booby-trapped.
We have to take the door.
Here you go, Cap.
Oh, easy, Cap. Easy.
CHIMNEY: What on earth?
HEN: We're never getting past that.
Not unless we have a bulldozer in the truck.
1968.
CHIMNEY: Here, hand it to me. Hand it to me.
What is that, a tunnel?
BETSY: They're total kooks.
Hoarders on steroids.
One I actually never seen. Never leaves the house.
The other, you know, every once in a while, you'll see him skulking around the neighborhood, goes out for groceries or newspapers.
And he circles the block three times before disappearing into the house.
It's like he's, uh, afraid someone's following him.
Trust me, no one's following him.
Same thing round back. Window's our best choice.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. Heads up!
Damn, this is insane! Hey, Cap, you got to see this!
BOBBY: Buck! Buck!
Buck!
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
I told you. Kooks!
ABBY: Okay, Cecil, the fire captain is on the line.
He'd like to speak with you, okay?
CECIL: Yes.
Yes, o-okay. All right.
Captain Nash, his name is Cecil. He's older. He seems fragile.
He's probably gonna require some patience.
Of course.
Captain Nash, this is Cecil Farrier.
His brother is the one who's trapped.
Cecil, my name is Bobby. I'm outside your place, and I'm gonna help find your brother.
We need to pick a window, and you need to disarm the traps.
I can't.
I'm blind.
Okay, well, Cecil, what's the best way into the house?
Through the back tunnel, b-but I think that's totally collapsed.
So there's only one way in: the-the front tunnel.
BOBBY: How far back does this tunnel go?
Maybe... 25 feet.
Stay to the right.
Just about halfway down, there's-there's a trap.
What happens if I trip it?
Uh, Winslow rigged a-a circular saw blade to-to fall through one of the cracks.
It would cut you right in two.
You disarm that, you disarm all the booby traps.
I can talk you through it.
Just please, please hurry.
What do you think, Buck?
I'm game, but... I don't think I'll fit.
I would.
Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs.
BUCK: What's that, Chim?
You make me sad, Buck.
Very sad.
Come on.
Okay, Cecil, I'm at the clock. What now?
CECIL: Is Copy. It's set to midnight.
So... move it to 11:11.
Copy.
Turn the clock to ease the tension on the trip wire.
Remember, that clock can set off other traps in the house.
You all right?
CHIMNEY: I'm good. I'm good.
Setting the clock to 11:11.
Nice and easy, now.
Slowly.
It's at 11:11!
All clear.
Cecil, can you hear me?
CECIL: Hello?
Oh, yeah, yes, yeah.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Where Coming. I'm coming.
Good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
Now-now you have to help me find my brother.
Okay, I will, I will, I will, I will.
Yeah, help. Yeah.
I promise you I will.
Uh, just stay here for one second, okay?
I'm just gonna let some light in here so I can see.
Don't move.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
How long have you been living like this?
Not sure what you mean. Uh...
Winslow and me-- we took the house after Mom and Dad died.
So, 1967, and...
Well, we had to protect the house, you know?
We-we wanted to make sure that nobody stole anything.
It's our house.
: It's our house, and we had to protect it, and I can't do this by myself, so I need you to help me find him right now.
I need you to stop what you're doing and help me find him right now!
I will. I will.
I promise you I'm gonna find your brother for you, okay?
But I need you to stay right here so I can go get him, all right?
Okay, yeah.
Okay.
Okay. Okay.
I'll be back.
I'll be back for you.
Okay. Find... find him.
Okay. Find him.
* Over here! He's here! Winslow!
You're gonna be all right, sir. We got you.
Just try to keep still. Grab my bag!
CHIMNEY: Cecil, he's okay.
We're gonna take care of you now. Please stay still.
Okay.
All right.
Ready? One, two, three!
Flip!
Ow!
HEN: All right, I see some blood down here.
Let me check it out, you guys.
All right, just keep...
Ooh.
Okay.
All right, hold on. We got a compound fractured tibia, penetrated to the skin.
A slight discoloration below the break.
BOBBY: Okay, check the dorsalis pedis pulse.
All right, sir.
I'm not finding anything.
He could lose his leg.
All right, we have to realign it, reestablish blood flow.
Okay, Buck, you and I stabilize.
Hen, Chim, do your thing.
Winslow, sorry. This is gonna hurt.
All right, hold him still. Hen, on three.
One, two, three!
All right. All right.
Keep your leg still! Keep your leg still!
Hard part's over. Now we got to get you to the hospital.
Okay, guys, strap him in.
No, no, no!
I-I can't leave... I can't leave my brother!
You're doing great. Stay still.
Hey. Yeah.
HEN: We're gonna get you out of here, sir.
You're gonna be fine, Winslow.
One, two, three, up!
All right.
HEN: Somebody grab my gear on the way out!
Winslow, it's okay. I'm here.
Easy, easy, easy.
BOBBY: Good job, guys. All right, keep going.
WINSLOW: No!
No! I can't leave. Please, I can't leave my brother behind.
I'm here. I'm here, Winslow.
Just... I'm here. Just let them take care of you.
I won't leave you, Cecil.
CECIL: You don't have to. You don't have to.
I'm... I'm-I'm coming with you.
* Sunny * Yesterday my life was filled with rain... * Um, you got to help my brother now.
He's fine. He's fine.
All right, Winslow, come on.
* Smiled at me and really eased the pain... * I'm here. I'm here.
* Oh, the dark days are gone * And the bright days are here * My Sunny one shines so sincere * * Oh, Sunny one so true * I love you.
Is this cool? Like, I figured we try someplace completely not special, so-so if you had to cancel it, you wouldn't feel bad.
I'm sorry.
This is great. This is great.
Um, so how's your mom doing?
Same. I mean, worse.
You know, she's having a hard time walking, and eating is getting tougher.
But the worst part, you know, is, like, it's just the memory and the personality.
But this disease-- it doesn't just eat away at it like cancer does.
It almost just pushes it away.
Yeah, and, um...
it sounds, it sounds... awful.
: Sorry. I know, it sounds awful.
And I'm sure you don't want to hear it, 'cause I don't want to hear it 'cause I don't even want to be going through it.
I-I do want to hear it.
Well...
All right, you're-you're living it, and I want, I want you to talk to me.
I know, but it's just...
I think there's a reason I've been doing this...
alone, you know?
It's hard to drag somebody through it.
I don't want... you know.
I don't want that for you.
You're breaking up with me, right?
I think I just... I'm letting you off the hook.
See, I feel like anyone else, most people, if they were dealing with the stuff you have to deal with every single day, they would, they would see it as a cage.
But you don't.
You find a way to break free.
You find a way to be yourself.
You find... life.
And if the price I have to pay for being close to a woman like you is, yeah, whatever, a couple of canceled dates, then, you know what?
Then that is one heck of a good deal, and I am in.
I'm not going anywhere.
AARON: Now, for the star of the show.
Ah.
Duck rendang.
ATHENA: Wow.
That's a good-looking duck.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
I bet your, uh, ex-husband wasn't a gourmet chef in his spare time.
Actually, Michael's a great cook.
Mm. There's great, and then there's duck rendang great.
Mm-hmm.
I want to run something by you.
I have a place in Big Sur.
I was thinking that we can get away for the weekend, hike, go on the beach.
No.
I can't go away with you.
I'm not even divorced yet.
It's a formality.
No. It's not.
I just got out of a 14-year marriage to a guy I thought I knew.
I'm figuring out how to be single at 50.
I'm not looking to jump into another relationship.
I want sex with no strings.
I don't need dinners or weekend getaways.
I got married because my biological clock was ticking.
I stayed married for the kids.
I'm getting divorced for myself.
I'm not ready for this.
And you...
You are too good to be somebody's rebound guy.
Okay.
I assume you're not gonna stay the night, then?
Well...
that depends...
Mm-hmm.
... on how good the duck is.
Uh, my lawyer says we're not supposed to talk.
Did you tell him that the only reason you're doing all of this is so that you and I will talk?
He is my son, too.
'Cause I carried him, I gave birth to him.
And you couldn't sign those papers to give him away fast enough, Eva. This isn't about Denny.
It's about you finding a way to get back with me.
: Well, what's wrong with that?
I mean, we could give him a better family.
Me and you, together.
He ha a family.
Now, I know that Diesel is the reason that you stayed with her all these years.
Her name is Karen.
And I love her.
But she's got you trapped, living this sad, suburban life that is not you, but when I get custody...
You know that's never gonna happen.
So tell me...
what do we have to do to make you stop this insanity?
What, you need money?
We don't got a lot, but, what, that's what it's gonna take?
I want you.
You had me, Eva.
You had me.
I loved you.
I would've done anything for you.
That wasn't enough. I wasn't enough.
See, you have this fantasy of us playing house, as if I hadn't already lived through that.
: I know how it goes.
I know how it goes.
It's me trying over and over and over to build a life for us, and you tearing it down brick by brick by brick until I'm left alone, heartbroken, in a hole that I don't even know how to climb out of.
I survived you, Eva.
And I'm sure as hell not gonna let you put Denny through this.
Wait.
Just wait.
Okay, it won't be like that this time.
Oh, I can be different.
Being in that cage-- it changed me.
I love you.
: I love you.
You are incapable of caring about anybody but yourself, which is why I will never let you near my son.
Count on that.
Count on it!
ABBY: A wolf will chew off its own leg just to escape.
("I of the Storm" by Of Monsters and Men playing) Which makes perfect sense.
* If I could face them * If I could make amends with all my shadows... * If you're being held back, cornered, forced into a situation, you do whatever you can to change it, to break free, to survive.
* But I feel it burning * Like when the winter wind stops my breathing... * But sometimes escape isn't our default.
* I fear you won't, I fear you don't... * Sometimes we stay the course.
We cope, we navigate.
* And it echoes when I breathe, till all you see... * Because traps don't look the same to everybody, especially not from inside one.
* Empty vessel, crooked teeth... * Sometimes what the rest of the world sees as having us pinned actually ends up pushing us forward, giving us purpose, control, someone to talk to.
And once in a while, the very thing everyone thinks is holding us back is also what makes us feel at home.
* With all my thoughts...
: Mom?
* I feel it biting, I feel it break my skin * : Mom.
* So uninviting * Are you really gonna need me when I'm gone? * : Mom?
* And they call me under Mom?!
* And I'm shaking like a leaf : Mom?!
* And they call me underneath * To the storm.
