So, Beth did what now?
She invited her mother to come stay with us for a month.
What are we running, a summer camp for the aged and ornery?
Ugh, wind's picking up. Easterly.
15 knots.
So, Estelle is leaving Vermont?
I thought she hated hot weather.
Apparently not as much as she loves torturing me.
♪<i> Manifest destiny,</i> <i> back in the days</i> ♪ ♪<i> We wanted everything...</i> ♪ (sighs) Look at all those tiny, lucky ant people down there.
Not a care in the world.
And all of those tiny ant people have a horrible, torturous story of their own, many of them involving a mother-in-law.

LTA Airship Six to tower.
<i> Two minutes out</i> <i> to our stadium flyover.</i> (cheering) <i> ANNOUNCER:</i> <i> Another record crowd today.</i> <i> And for those lucky fans</i> <i> who correctly guess</i> <i> today's attendance number,</i> <i> you can win a VIP package...</i> Record crowds?
This gets worse by the minute.
Mom.
Excuse me!
Watch where you're going!
Mom, you seriously need to chill.
I will not chill.
After everything you've been through in the last year, I don't know how you could possibly think that being in a stadium filled with 50,000 people was a good idea.
It only holds 23 and a half. I checked.
Mom, what has this past year been about?
Okay? Me getting better.
So that I get to do all the normal things that everyone else gets to do without batting an eye.
EMPLOYEE: Order up.
This isn't normal.
It's reckless.
No, these are reckless.
And too much cheese isn't good for you either.
This isn't cheese. It's cheese-adjacent.
You're my little baby girl.
I just don't want to lose you.
Mom. Stop.
Look, it's a beautiful day.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Things are looking up.
Deflecting starboard rudder.
New heading radial, 48 degrees.
(loud bang) (alarm whistling) Elevator wheel's disabled.
SUZIE: Rudder pedals, too.
The fire must've burned through the lines.
(alarm beeping rapidly) Mayday, mayday, mayday! LTA Airship Six to tower!
We are going down!
(line ringing) Who the hell are you calling?
Copy that. Have you notified air traffic control?
They are aware. <i> Where's</i> your anticipated landing zone? LAPD can clear the area. <i> You're not gonna</i> clear 20,000 people in time.
Where are you headed?
Nearing the 110, headed for Cal-M Stadium.
How close are you, sir?
<i> 200 feet.</i> All units, all units, be advised-- <i> we have a blimp</i> <i> losing altitude.</i> (siren wailing) <i> About to crash</i> <i> into Cal-M Stadium.</i> <i> Close the 110</i> <i> from MLK to Exposition.</i> <i> Shut down the Metro E Line.</i> <i> Deploy emergency mass</i> <i> casualty protocol plan.</i> (siren wailing) (horn honking) Wind's picking up.
Change of plans!
Headed right for the stadium!
(gasping, shouting) I can't pull up!
Come on, girl! Come on!
You can make it a little bit further!
<i> DAVE:</i> <i> We're not gonna make it!</i> Bracing for impact!
(alarm beeping rapidly) (crashing) (screaming) FAN: Oh, my God!
It's a bomb! Run!
Oh, God! Run!
Fay! Fay!
(screaming) Fay! Fay!
Mom!
(yelling) Mom!
Mom! Mom!
(screaming) Oh! Let's get you out of here!
Oh, my gosh.
She's got a bomb. She's got a bomb!
(screaming) <i> MAN:</i> <i> Dispatch, be advised,</i> <i> the blimp has crashed</i> <i> into a lighting truss</i> <i> on the south side</i> <i> of the stadium.</i> <i> Approximately 60 feet</i> <i> off the ground.</i> (clamoring) Buck, Hen, kill that light tower.
Eddie, once the ladder's in position, you and Chimney run point.
Glad they don't fill those things with hydrogen anymore.
(screaming) Remain calm!
There has been an accident!
There has not been an attack!
What? No, you're wrong! There's a lady with a backpack!
It's got all these wires coming out! I think it's a bomb!
Take him to the safe zone and stay with him!
I'm gonna take a look!
727-L-30 to Dispatch, I just received a report of a possible IED <i> on a female in the concourse.</i> <i> Copy,</i> 727-L-30. We sure that's not a mistake?
That's what I'm gonna find out.
HEN: Cap, power's out. Safe to approach.
All right, let's bring it up.
<i>BOBBY (over comm): Eddie, Chim,</i> <i>ladder's moving into position.</i> <i> Let's get that fire out.</i> (crowd screaming) Dispatch, this is 727-L-30.
I got possible visual on IED at the eastern concourse.
It's-it's-- It's not... it's not a bomb.
It's my heart.
Please...
... find my mom.
Dispatch, I got eyes on the alleged IED.
It's definitely not a bomb. Some kind of medical device.
She says it's for her heart.
I'm sending you a picture now.
Uh, that looks like a pneumatic pump for an artificial heart.
It sends air through the tubes to power an implant in her chest.
I don't think it's functioning. She just lost consciousness.
<i> Her pulse is barely there.</i> Must be damaged.
Should I start CPR?
No. The implant is made of hard plastic.
<i> Compressions will only</i> <i> jam it into her sternum.</i> <i> Do you see another backpack?</i> Another one?
She wouldn't go without a backup.
Someone else must have it.
(device beeps) I think her heart's shutting down.
How long do I have?
<i> If the heart is shutting down,</i> <i> minutes.</i> Fire's out, Cap. Swing us over to the cab.
All right, bring 'em on back.
<i> BOBBY:</i> <i> Not sure how long you'll have.</i> <i> Blimp's getting heavier</i> <i> as it deflates.</i> Making entry. (grunts) <i> BOBBY:</i> <i> Wind's picking up.</i> Careful. Every pound of weight distribution matters in this thing.
Noted.
Just scoot over slowly.
We're gonna go one in, one out.
There we go. Just slide...
Okay.
Your hand. Okay.
I got you.
(loud creaking) <i> BOBBY: That's it, Chim,</i> <i> nice and easy.</i> Nice and easy. Let's get her down here.
<i> Eddie, Buck is on his way up</i> <i> to help you</i> <i> evacuate the co-pilot.</i> On your left. (grunts) (panting) Eddie. Hey.
<i> EDDIE:</i> <i> Cap, pilot's coming, too.</i> <i> BOBBY:</i> <i>All right, Buck, you move fast,</i> <i> you move safe. Let's go.</i> Sir, can you feel the pressure I'm applying?
Yeah. Yeah.
Good.
Ma'am, I need you to stay still.
You may be injured.
I'm gonna call for help.
Dispatch, I need a team to the east escalator bank for an injured woman.
My daughter...
Yes. I'm on my way to her right now.
Stay put here. Help is coming, okay?
Dispatch, I have the device.
On three.
One...
(pilot groans) ... two, three.
(groaning) You got it.
Eddie, this thing is really rocking. You got to be ready.
(crowd clamoring) Cap, lower me three feet.
Copy that, Buck.
Tachycardic. Pulse is strong.
Didn't see any gross fractures in her extremities.
Everything's clear.
(woman groaning) BP's 152/90.
Do you feel any pain in your abdomen, ma'am?
No. My daughter.
What about your daughter?
She's still inside.
I'm here. What do I do?
<i> MADDIE: Remove the broken pump</i> <i> from the backpack</i> <i> and unspool the clear tube.</i> <i> Disconnect them from the</i> <i>connectors around her waistline.</i> It should look like a plumbing fitting. <i> Okay.</i> Then attach the connectors to the new device.
<i> Once it's secure,</i> <i> put in the battery,</i> <i> and it should power up.</i> (beeps) Come on.
(grunting) Nice and easy.
(creaking) Eddie, this thing is gonna go.
Come on.
(device beeping) Any movement?
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
(gasps) She's breathing.
(exhales) Well, they say any landing you can walk away from is a good landing.
Hey, you're alive. (chuckles) You, too.
(chuckles) Hey, so, how they gonna get the rest of that thing down?
Not our problem.
Is she okay?
She's doing fine.
Mom?
You're gonna be okay. Okay, I'll see you there.
It's okay.
How was crowd control, Sergeant?
Got called in to do an emergency heart transplant instead.
(scoffs) Well, you win.
Eh, who's keeping score?
(both laugh) BOBBY: What did the doctor say?
<i> I'm definitely broken.</i> How'd you break your foot off-duty?
<i> HEN:</i> <i> Yeah, we thought you were</i> <i> going to that</i> <i> family reunion weekend.</i> Yeah. That's how I broke it.
We were playing football, I got shoved from behind, and I just rolled my ankle.
HEN AND CHIMNEY: Avulsion fracture of the fifth metatarsal.
<i> Yeah, what they said.</i> Happens a lot when you roll your ankle.
Wait, so-so, one of your brothers pushed you from behind?
My niece Delilah.
<i>She's seven and kind of vicious.</i> <i> She's my favorite.</i> So we probably won't see you for a few weeks, then?
<i> Doctor says between four</i> <i> and six weeks.</i> <i> I am really sorry, Cap.</i> <i> I hope I didn't ruin</i> <i> your honeymoon.</i> Don't worry about it, I'll find somebody else to cover.
You just let us know if you need anything.
All right, gang, let's get ready to turn it over to B-shift.
Uh, hey, hey, Cap.
Um, wh-what did Lucy mean about ruining your trip?
I was gonna have her fill in for me when I was gone.
Uh, you were gonna make Lucy interim captain?
She, she hasn't even been here that long.
Not the 118, but she's been a firefighter for almost ten years.
She's more than qualified.
Well, yeah, but o-other people here are also qualified.
Hey, I appreciate the vote of confidence, kid, but I don't need to pressure Cap into asking me.
I'd like to pressure him into not asking you.
BOBBY: Oh, you want to be interim captain again?
Because the last time you did it, I recall the words "never again." That was from the rest of us.
(laughs) Thanks, Cap. But never again.
It is nice to be asked, though.
So it doesn't bother you?
That Bobby didn't even consider either one of us for interim captain?
Not really. Just got back to the 118.
Clearly it's bothering you.
Listen, don't get me wrong, I think Lucy is whatever.
You know, she's great, but she's out.
You know, I think it's weird that he's struggling to pick a replacement when he has so many other excellent options right under his nose.
Like you?
It's like he's choosing not to see them and everything they have to offer.
Time. Aw, you'll win next time.
What are you offering?
Right now, Bobby's famous lasagna.
Six types of cheese, cooked to perfection.
Okay, very hot.
Don't use your hands.
It does look good.
Smells really good, too.
And it only took me three tries to get it right.
I'm not sure you get three tries on a job.
At least not without a significant body count.
I just want to know what these other candidates have that apparently I don't.
CHRISTOPHER: Buck, you don't even have a couch.
(Eddie laughs) Uh...
Boom!
... so what does that have to do with being fire captain?
It's weird.
(Eddie snickers) My last two couches came with girlfriends.
I think you mean your last two girlfriends came with couches.
Taylor moved out, what, four months ago, Buck?
You could have replaced the couch by now.
Uh, well, maybe I don't want to pick the wrong couch again.
Maybe that's how Bobby feels about interim captain.
(both laughing) CHIMNEY: Hey.
Sorry to bust in on your night off.
No worries. What happened?
Well, we were getting ready for bed, we heard rain.
Found out it was raining in my kitchen.
Oh. What did your landlord say?
He's with the plumber right now.
Hopefully it'll be an easy fix.
(Chimney exhales sharply) Calling a plumber at 9:00 on a Saturday night?
Daddy.
Can you say "double overtime"?
Oh, my God, did you have plans?
No, I just ordered in. I was gonna finish that movie we started watching last week. Here we go.
Whoa. Without me?
Maddie, you fell asleep watching it. Twice.
Okay, well, maybe third time's the charm.
(Chimney laughs) (phone chiming) Is that the landlord?
Yeah.
I should have water by tomorrow.
(phone chiming) Or Wednesday.
Sounds like your landlord needs to find a better plumber.
Yeah. And I'm gonna need a hotel room because I can't go four days without running water.
You know who else has running water? Me.
Why don't you just stay here? I'll crash on the couch.
You girls can have the bedroom.
Yeah, I wouldn't want to impose.
Maddie...
we're still family, hmm? That's what we do.
We look out for each other.
Don't we, Baby Jee?
All right.
Now, remember to keep your head down.
I know.
Keep that left arm straight.
I know.
Just pretend you're swinging in a barrel.
Okay, Dad, what does that even mean?
All right. It means you want to keep all your weight back on your right foot.
Minimize your hip turn when you swing.
(wood chipper rumbling) Keep your head down, looking at the ball.
Wait, what?
You want to keep your weight back, limiting your-your...
Wait, I...
(rumbling) Hey. Hey, guys!
Do you mind? We-We're trying to hit here.
(shuts off) ELTON: You know what?
Forget it. I'll shut up, just do whatever feels natural. But...
I'm gonna give you a little good luck charm. (chuckles) Your lucky ball? Come on, Dad.
Don't put more pressure on me.
Ah, come on. You can do it.
(clangs) Oh, I hate this stupid game.
I didn't see it come down, but I'm sure we'll find it.
You know, there's another thing that could be affecting your swing.
That new hardware on your left hand.
My wedding ring?
Dad, don't even start.
Vito and I are married now whether you like it or not.
We're very happy, I might add.
I'm not talking about your shotgun wedding.
Only that you should try wearing a rubber wedding band on the course like I do.
You never used to play this bad when you and Joey were dating.
Yes, I did.
You just didn't care because you and Joey would always team up and "go low" or whatever.
Half the time I'd quit at the turn, and you barely seemed to notice.
ELTON: Man, that Joey was one hell of a putter.
Great on the fairway, too.
You sure he wasn't the one?
Yes.
(wood chipper starts) (Leon screaming) God!
Aah!
Are you okay?
Yeah. I think so.
That ring saved my hand.
(sirens wailing) (horn honks) Dispatch, 118 is at the golf course.
Victim in sight.
How long has he been down?
We heard there was a shooting. I got this one, Cap.
Uh, have you recovered the weapon?
Negative. It's still embedded in the victim's chest.
BUCK: Okay, we better double-time it.
You guys know what to do. Let's go, let's go, come on.
Hang in there, Dad. Help is here.
BOBBY: Excuse me, sir, can you step back?
My team is gonna take a look at your dad.
I'll take a look at that hand.
Let's move back here, give them some space.
EDDIE: I got you, sir, I got you.
(Elton groaning) HEN: Looks like we got a keyhole thoracic entry wound on the right sternum.
Bleeding is steady, but from the lack of spurting, looks like it missed the aorta.
(Elton groans) EDDIE: Heart rate is 165 BPM.
Systolic BP is 98, indicating the patient was likely struck by a large-caliber round.
What was your dad shot with?
My tungsten wedding ring.
Never saw that in combat.
Based on his bilateral breathing, it looks like his ribs stopped the ring from puncturing the lung.
Preparing hemostatic bandaging to pack the wound.
Running morphine and fluids.
How exactly did this happen?
I was trying to fish a ball out of the wood chipper, but my hand got sucked into the blade.
My ring jammed it long enough for my hand to slide out.
But then the ring just went through.
Don't worry, Cap, securing the perimeter. I'm on it.
CHIMNEY: Well, your five fingers are still intact.
None of them appear to be broken, so I guess you're very fortunate you're not single.
All right, let's get him on a gurney and transport.
Doctors should be able to remove the offending ring at the hospital.
I'm gonna call Mom and tell her to meet us at the hospital.
Oh, and tell Joey I'm not gonna make it to the driving range tonight.
You're seriously still playing golf with my ex-boyfriend?
He's like the son I never had.
The one who can play golf.
Being a 911 dispatcher will be challenging and exhausting, and can take an emotional toll.
The people who call are scared, in need, and we are their lifeline.
But it's also rewarding.
Calling us is probably the scariest moment of their lives.
But if we do our jobs right and help arrives in time and we get a little lucky, then maybe it doesn't have to be the worst moment of their lives.
She nails it every time.
Do you have goose bumps?
Don't you?
A new call center, a new team of dispatchers, and Chimney asking you to move back in with him.
Everything's returning to normal around here.
I wouldn't go that far.
He did not ask me to move back in.
I'm just staying with him for a few days.
Or forever.
It's not like that.
Why not?
You clearly still love each other.
Just get back together already.
What if he's not ready for that? You know?
I know that he loves me, I just don't know if he wants to be with me.
You can't keep playing these guessing games, Maddie.
If you can't figure out what he wants, maybe you should tell him what you want.
MAY: Wow, they all look so... young.
These are your future college roommates?
Yeah.
But when they see me walk in, they're gonna think I'm their R. A.
Are you having second thoughts?
I mean, I said I wanted the full college experience, and here it is.
Mm-hmm.
Now, I'm sure I'll adjust.
I mean, I have to, right?
It's not like I can go back to my job or my apartment or all the other things I gave up to be roomed with three high school girls that were randomly selected for me by a computer.
I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Okay.
I'll be fine.
It's going to be an adventure.
Enjoy it.
Yes.
All right, what do you think?
MAY: That you're a mustache away from giving serious <i> Magnum P. I.</i> vibes.
(chuckles) Hey, I'm in full cruise mode here.
I got to make sure my resort wear is on par with the competition.
Why don't you bring both of them?
When else would you get a chance to wear those at home?
Well, I would, but I already committed to one small roller bag.
Well, how many bags are you bringing, Mom?
More than one.
Uh-huh, and I have accounted for that.
Our stateroom is exactly 330 square feet...
Oh, my.
... but the closet's only 25.
I don't want us stepping over our bags the whole time.
ATHENA: 330 square feet?
I mean, let me guess.
That's already been logged in to the cruise spreadsheet?
Right next to the dinner specials and the daily activities.
And I still need you to sign off on some of my selections so we can lock those down.
I told you I'm good with the branzino.
Right.
I just don't see why I would have to jump off of a perfectly good boat for no reason.
It's called snorkeling, and it's fun.
It's a whole nother world down there.
I'm more than happy with the one I'm in.
Which one?
The shirt on the right.
Done.
(chuckles) Looks like you're gonna have an adventure, too.
(May laughs) (upbeat fanfare playing) ROD BILLINGS (over bullhorn): Welcome to Rod Billings Cars and the annual "touch a car, win a car" contest.

(screaming) (snickers) Oh, God!
(horns honking) (sirens wailing) We got a call about an injured-- Hey, how long have these people been standing out here?
28 hours.
Uh, is that even legal?
Let's take a listen.
(panting) Ma'am, when's the last time you had any water?
Two days.
Been trying not to drink that much because water equals pee, and pee equals losing.
And I need this car.
Well, based on your lower back pain and what sounded like fluid in your lungs, I'm guessing you're suffering from acute kidney failure. Not to mention you probably damaged your bladder.
Look, I need to keep one hand on this car at all times. Can't you run an IV in the other arm or something?
(chuckles): Okay...
How you feeling, sir? I can't imagine it'd be easy being out in the sun going on two days.
I'm doing fine.
I could go a whole nother day.
(chuckles) REMI: Me, too.
Cap, we got to do something. She's refusing to leave.
My guy won't budge either. He's in it to win it.
Okay, how about this competition gets paused so they can get treatment?
You can pick it up in a day or two, maybe inside so they're out of the elements?
Sorry, but no can do.
What do you think people are gonna say when they find out a woman died at your dealership?
I am trying to give you an out here.
Rules are rules.
Okay, and the rules are they have to keep one hand on one part of the vehicle at all times, right?
That's right.
Okay, Buck?
Oh, am I on it, Cap.
Saws and jaws.
"Saws"?
You're not gonna cut that lady's arm off, are you?
I don't need to. She just needs to keep her hand on some part of the vehicle at all times.
You didn't say that part has to remain attached to the vehicle.
You can't just come in here and carve up my inventory like that!
Hey, "rules are rules." Oh, hey, more reporters.
It's gonna play great on the morning news.
(saw buzzing) <i> They both win a car!</i> <i> Because here</i> <i> at Billings Auto Emporium,</i> <i> the only thing bigger than</i> <i> our deals are our hearts.</i> (knocking) Athena?
Wait, what time is it?
3:15.
(groans) Our lunch date was 2:00, wasn't it?
Yep. I figured you forgot, but after you canceled the last few times, decided that I would force the issue.
Even brought you some tacos from Don Rivera's.
Your favorite.
Oh... (chuckles) Friend.
I don't know whether to lead with "I'm so sorry" or "Thank you, I'm starving." Ah, neither is necessary.
I know how busy you've been with work, family and medical school.
(scoffs) Oof.
It's starting to feel like I'm the living example of that whole "be careful what you wish for" thing right now.
I hear you have some big exams coming up next week.
End of year two.
I used to think they were exaggerating about how bad the boards would be.
Now I'm starting to think that maybe they undersold it.
(laughs) Oh, I know you must be feeling a lot of pressure. Have you talked to David?
I mean, he's been where you are.
Is he coming back from Haiti soon?
Oh, it doesn't sound like it. He, Michael and Harry have set up a home base in Miami, and David commutes from there.
How do you feel about all that?
(phone chimes) Now, you know I miss Harry.
But he sounds happy.
That's what matters to me.
All right, well, maybe I will give David a call.
(phone chiming) I just need to get through these finals and then I can take a breath.
Who is that texting you?
Just some cruise update from Bobby.
I mean, he has been watching this ship's activity calendar like it's the ball dropping from Times Square on New Year's.
What? I thought the whole point of those things was to unplug and relax.
It is for me, but Bobby wants to keep busy.
Six nights, seven days.
11 bars.
Oh.
I'm sure it's not the easiest place in the world for someone who's in the program.
But he's trying to show me a good time, so I don't mind returning the favor.
(phone chimes) Oh.
Oh, great.
An eco-tour?
Listen.
If that trip gets to be too much, you could always hide in the spa.
If? Okay.
(music playing) Huh, did not see that coming.
Ooh, what'd I miss?
(scoffs) I missed everything.
Again.
Third time is definitely not the charm.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
Why don't you just go to bed?
Because I hate admitting defeat.
And it's still really early.
Isn't it?
(both laugh) You know, it's weird, the only reason why I picked this movie is 'cause I thought you would like it.
I don't know. Maybe I just don't have the patience for these movies anymore, you know?
Two people meet, you know that they're gonna end up together.
And then you have to watch 'em bumble their way through stupid misunderstandings for two hours.
I don't know. It's kind of annoying.
So you'd rather your rom-coms have less "com." I don't know.
I guess I would rather see two people overcome real problems and...

You fled your own apartment?
What? I had to get to work.
Two hours early?
You know how the morning after can get kind of awkward?
I just figured it might be easier for me to not be there for it. Is that so bad?
Don't look at me.
I once asked Shannon to sneak out of my house so Christopher wouldn't see her in my bed.
(chuckles) You see?
Compared to that, I'm as chivalrous as Sir Galahad.
Or as delusional as Don Quixote.
I don't understand. Isn't this what you've been wanting?
What the two of you been working towards?
It is, it just feels like I'm waiting for...
something.
Well, with Shannon, I tried to tell myself I was doing it to protect Christopher.
The truth is, I was just doing it to protect myself.
What's wrong with that?
You didn't skip the morning after conversation, Chim.
You just delayed it.
And you added a whole new complicated layer.
I had a one-night stand with my ex.
I don't know what the rules are.
Maybe that's what you need to find out.
Whoa!
I am so sorry!
That I bumped into you? Don't be.
I-I'm...
Maddie!
Your class is sort of legend at the academy.
A 7.1 earthquake your first day on floor.
I'm Noah.
Uh, good to meet you, Noah.
So, any tips for the newbie?
(exhales) Remember to breathe.
(chuckles) The person on the other end is already panicked and they don't need you to be.
Sounds easy.
I'm pretty sure it isn't.
It gets easier eventually.
What's your name and where are you calling from?
My name is Kenyon and we live at 646 Ridgeline Court.
<i> Hi, Kenyon. I'm Maddie.</i> How old are you? <i> I'm 12.</i> <i> But my brother's only six.</i> My mom left me to look after him while she went to the grocery store and now he's gone.
Okay, start from the beginning. What happened?
We were playing hide-and-seek and he just disappeared.
Jeremy!
What, do you think maybe he's still hiding?
<i> I don't know.</i> <i> It's been a really long time.</i> <i> And I've looked everywhere.</i> I keep yelling his name, and he always comes out when he can tell I'm mad.
Jeremy! <i> Okay.</i> Usually we don't send the police until we know someone's missing.
But I'm gonna send an officer to you just in case.
What if he ran away?
Has he done that in the past?
<i> No, but I used to</i> <i> when I was his age.</i> "Used to"?
Why'd you stop? <i> My mom.</i> <i> She'd get so scared.</i> It took her a really long time to stop worrying about me.
Yeah, yeah.
I bet it's hard to get over being afraid like that.
What are you afraid of?
Uh, what?
<i>Is there someplace in the house</i> <i> or the yard</i> <i> that no one ever goes?</i> Someplace that's so creepy you hate having to go there?
Uh, under the house.
My mom used to store Christmas decorations under there.
Sounds exactly like the last place your brother would expect you to look for him.
Are you serious, Jeremy?!
Dang it!
You found me.
MOTHER: I'm home!
<i> I got to go. Thanks, Maddie.</i> Yeah, you're welcome.
(chuckles) Hi.
I'm not leaving.
The apartment or...?
This family.
That's what you called us, and that's what I want.
The three of us together.
That's...
that's what I want, too.
When I woke up the other morning and you were gone, I felt... sad.
Yeah.
Probably the way you felt every day those six months that I was gone.
Look, I don't expect you to keep apologizing for that.
I'm not.
We're past apologies.
This is a promise.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm done running.
Me, too.
(chuckles) (indistinct radio transmission) (grunting) What you doing in my ambulance?
Uh,<i> our</i> ambulance, and...
I got to say, Wilson, it's kind of a mess in there.
No labels on the drawers.
Tough for an outsider to find their way around.
Sort of the point.
If I'm elected interim captain, I would have you doing some serious maintenance right now.
A whole organizational overhaul.
This is not a class president election, Buckley.
And you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
What I'm talking about is, your fluid levels are also low.
Oh, really, which ones?
'Cause I just topped off the oil, transmission, brake and coolant.
Per my report, your windshield wiper reservoir is down to three-quarters full.
Uh, you can't just take that.
It's department property.
And a weapon in the wrong hands.
Cap, you need to officially announce your replacement because I can't take any more of Buck trying to prove himself.
Oh, that's what he's been doing.
I'll have a talk with him.
So, who is it gonna be?
Our new interim captain.
It's a tough call.
And, honestly, I wanted it to be you.
(stammers) Me?
What?
You're smart, dedicated, compassionate, and you're decisive.
You're a great leader.
(stammers, chuckles) I mean...
you know when I first entered this department, Captain Gerrard didn't even see me as a firefighter.
And now, 12 years later, my boss is telling me that I have everything it takes to make a great captain.
And you do.
But you didn't pick me.
I know how much you have going on outside of work.
And I didn't want to overburden you.
It's not that much of a burden, Cap, I'm already here.
Right, there's all this paperwork...
Already do a lot of paperwork, Cap.
This can add another hour or two to every shift.
You'll be gone a week. That's what?
Three shifts?
Okay, so you'll do it?
Yeah.
I'll do it.
(indistinct radio transmission) Hey.
Oh, uh, h-hey, Cap.
I'm so sorry this is still such a mess.
I'll have it polished and reorganized within the hour.
I think it all looks great.
I see you've been going the extra mile lately and I appreciate it.
Oh, just trying to show you what I got.
I already know what you got, Buck.
But I'm not naming you interim captain.
Hen has agreed to take on that role.
Okay?
Um, yeah, no, I mean...
come on, it's Hen, she'll-she'll make a great captain.
And so will you.
Someday.
You're a great firefighter.
When you're all in, nobody goes harder than you.
But being a good leader is about more than just the work. It's also about life experience.
And I think you need some more of that before you're ready.
Is this 'cause I don't have a couch?
Why don't you have a couch?
I-I don't know, um...
I guess I-I've been having trouble picking one out.
I think I'm afraid of making a mistake again.
In AA there's this idea that you take inventory of your life admit your shortcomings in hopes that one day you can look at the world straight in the eye and be alone at perfect peace and ease.
Come on, you, uh, you don't think I'm at ease? (chuckles) I think the important thing is that you answer that question for yourself.
But when you are, you'll know.
And then you'll be ready.
