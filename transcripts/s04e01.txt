I--I can't leave.
If I do, I'm gonna have a panic attack.
I'll hyperventilate. I could go into cardiac arrest.
How long?
Seven years.
You weren't going to evacuate, were you?
It's not safe out there.
Don't be scared. <i> But she's out there.</i> Right where they're saying there could be a landslide.
She's probably just helping out with evacuations.
Aren't you worried? It's too soon.
<i>Hey, your mom is doing her job.</i> And I'm sure she'd want you to be doing the same.
Actually, that's a lie. She still wants you to quit.
Oh, Bobby, I gotta go.
<i>Okay, you take care.</i> You know, today was my first day back on the job.
Six months since I last put on this uniform.
What happened?
I was... injured.
Line of duty.
Took some time to heal.
Not everything heals in six months.
You're right about that.
My arm's fixed, but the rest of me?
I even lied to my husband this morning.
Told him that I would be all right.
Didn't mention that it took everything in my being to get out of that bed this morning and pick up this badge.
Then I lied to my captain.
Hell, maybe I've been lying to myself.
What do you think those shoes are?
And this outfit? And the makeup?
It's the same lie.
It's a game that I play with myself that someday...
maybe... I will go out there.
And then I never do.
But now you really need to, because this hill is about to come down on itself and take you with it.
Maybe I should let it.
You got up this morning.
And put on makeup.
You're still in the game.
It's the motion sensor on Mount Lee.
Mount Lee?
Hollywood Hills.
Our comm towers are out there.
So is my mom.
Wait, is that another quake?
I'm not feeling it.
But we have cameras there in case of trespassers.
Okay, there's the sign.
Is it moving? Oh, my God.
You got this, Sylvia.
