No, I, uh, I didn't know that.
Sorry.
Um, thanks.
And she's just... slipping, you know?
She's getting worse, and I...
I'm starting to feel like she might need more... than just me.
More help. Professional help.
Y-You mean like a home?
Yeah. Although even as you say it out loud, I'm paralyzed with guilt at the thought of it.
I mean, she's my mom. Right?
Yeah, that's rough.
Look, I don't... I don't know a lot.
But if there's one thing I learned over the last 24 hours, the only thing that matters is family.
Right.
Yes.
You're so right.
Thank you.
Yeah, you got it.
Um...
Look, I'll talk to you soon. Okay?
Tatiana. I'm Bobby.
We spoke on the phone.
Oh, yeah. Hi.
( <em>Chuckles softly</em> )
Now I know why Chimney always calls you Gary Cooper.
I see you've had some visitors.
Yeah.
All day and last night, too.
Is that normal, or is Chimney just really popular?
Firefighters are a brotherhood.
Cops are the same way.
One of us goes down, we make sure the family's looked after.
And I'm the family?
I was hoping to convince you to come to the hospital to visit him.
I thought you said that he wasn't awake.
They're bringing him out of his coma now.
It'd be good if you were there.
( <em>Sighs</em> )
He asked me to marry him.
I know.
It's not right, you know.
Putting me in that kind of situation.
Either I say yes or I'm some kind of monster.
You don't have to say yes.
You just have to come hold his hand.
This is not about love, it's about decency.
That's my point.
Anything I do now that isn't being Florence Nightingale, it makes me look like some kind of jerk.
So, I hold his hand when he wakes up.
Then it's stay with him until he's out of the hospital.
And then it's you can't break up with him until he can walk or talk again, and that's assuming that he ever can.
And you want me to just play like I'm in love for how long?
A month? A year?
I am not a bad person.
I am just not in love with him.
Tatiana.
My friend is coming out of a medically induced coma.
I don't know if he'll ever fully wake up.
And if he does, I don't know if he's gonna be able to talk or see or hear or even remember who I am.
I am not asking you to love him or marry him, and I'm not judging you for your feelings. I'm not.
I'm just saying he loves you.
Misguided as he may be.
And the only two things I can think of to help him are to pray and to hope that if you're with him, he'll feel that love for you and it will give him a reason to fight his way back to us.
( <em>Sighs</em> ) I'm sorry.
I just can't.
<strong>Abby</strong>: <em>Okay.</em>
Um, she's had her midday pills, except I think I might have used next week's day-of-the-week box by accident.
Would you mind just checking on that?
We'll get it squared away.
Thank you.
So, should I ask?
What?
Am I about to be out of a job?
Oh.
No. My brother left that.
Oh. Oh.
This is a good place.
Is it?
Mm-hmm.
Vacancies are rare.
Huh.
Are you considering it?
( <em>Clicks tongue</em> ) I was for a minute.
But then I thought, you know, as long as my mom is still here with me...
( <em>Sighs</em> ) I want her to be here with me.
( <em>School bell rings</em> )
( <em>Girl whoops</em> )
We're going, we're going.
( <em>Indistinct radio chatter</em> )
( <em>Indistinct chatter</em> )
( <em>Monitor beeping</em> )
He's a tough nut.
He's gonna be in this room for a few days.
Intubation tube is out, obviously, but the catheter's still in.
Can he hear us?
I always treat them like they can.
All right, two minutes, and then I'm kicking you out.
Hey, Chim.
We're all here for you, buddy.
H-Hey.
I-I was thinking maybe when you come back to work, um, you know, you should do The Maneuver instead of me.
To motivate him to get better.
( <em>Whispering</em> ): He can't do The Maneuver.
Yeah, he can.
Hey, Chim, you can do The Maneuver.
Right?
( <em>All chuckle</em> )
Chim.
I, um...
I tried to get ahold of your parents.
There's a 16-hour time difference with Seoul, you know, so maybe... maybe that has something to do with it.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Yeah, it's all right.
His family's right here.
Please don't ever let him do The Maneuver.
( <em>Stifled laughter</em> )
