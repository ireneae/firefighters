BUCK: If there's one hard thing you learn in this job it's that, one way or the other, this day or the next, eventually...
everything dies.
For most people, the only thing worse than losing someone you love is knowing that, one day, you will.
Mom, Dad, I want you to know I-I've decided to sell the house.
I know how much it meant to you guys.
It did to me, too.
Please don't be mad.
(sighs) (low groan) (gasps) (low groaning) So, we have one guy still missing?
Yes, it's horrible.
Elisio and Stavros were preparing Mrs. Mandechek's final resting place, and they just got sucked in.
Okay.
Sir, can you tell me what happened down there?
Me and Stavros were...
digging a plot...
(coughs) when we got pulled in.
Like the grave was digging itself.
A sinkhole. The quake shifted everything around down there.
We're all basically walking around on eggshells and bubble wrap. See it?
How long ago did this happen?
I don't know.
Half an hour, maybe?
Let's move, guys.
Whoa...
Easy. This whole side is like quicksand.
I don't want you to fall in there and drag ten tons of loose soil on top of yourself and our friend down there.
He's been breathing dirt for a half hour, Cap.
Well, maybe not.
What are you thinking?
Eggshells and bubble wrap.
Air pockets.
Yeah, we just have to find out where they are.
Whoa, th-those aren't...
BOBBY: Coffins and corpses.
That's where the air pockets are.
That's messed up.
(beeping) BOBBY: Oh. Hello, Stavros.
All right, shovels and buckets.
Let's go.
Here you go.
Got one.
Whoa!
Whoa. You okay?
Yeah.
Okay, that can't be good.
Keys for this thing?
Sh-Should still be in it.
We're gonna get this man out of here one damn way or another. Clear out!
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
BOBBY: All right, fellas.
CHIMNEY: Get out. Get out, guys. Come on.
(engine starts) Oh! I got-I got him.
(Stavros grunting) Okay, easy. Easy. You're okay.
Take it slow. Take...
(gasping deeply) CHIMNEY: All right, we got you.
HEN: All along...Hang on.
We got you, Stavros, we got you.
BOBBY: Nice and slow.
Try to relax.
Breathe, breathe. Relax. Relax.
We got you. Relax. We got you.
(grunting) CHIMNEY: We got you. Try to relax.
Now, that was strictly badass.
You literally pulled a man from a grave.
(chuckles) We did. I just hope they understand.
Hope who understands?
The spirits we disturbed.
I don't need that mess following me home.
(rumbling) Hey. What's going on?
That phone call was pretty cryptic.
It's about your father.
My father?
What are you talking about, Karen?
I haven't spoken to my father since...
I was, like, nine.
He's in the ICU.
This hospital? He's here?
Yeah.
He was brought in yesterday, unconscious.
They've been trying to get in touch with us ever since.
How did they know to look for me?
He had your name and our address in his wallet.
DOCTOR: Your father suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage.
It caused bleeding within the brain.
So what's the prognosis here?
Well, we're seeing severe, widespread damage.
HEN: These machines are the only thing keeping him alive.
And you want to know whether or not to withdraw life support.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry.
Without an advance directive, our protocol is to treat, to keep him alive until we can contact the next of kin.
And that's me.
911. What is your emergency?
(radio static): HIKER (panting): Uh, I was hiking, fell off...(grunts) The cliff gave out.
Can you-can you hear me?
Uh, I-I can hear you, sir.
I'm here. Do you know where you fell?
I w...I was on the San Ramon Trail. I think...
(feedback whines) Oh, God. I broke my leg, for sure.
I can see the bone in...
I-I can barely hear you, sir.
Can you tell me precisely where on the trail?
Vista Point, Abalone Cove.
I'm bleeding. Please, God, help me. Please...
(sharp feedback) (beep) (noise stops) Hello?
HEN: I'm staring at this stranger in this bed, tubes coming out of him.
I don't know this man.
How am I supposed to make a life-and-death decision for a total stranger?
Hen, you do realize we're not driving around in a mail truck here?
You make life-or-death decisions for total strangers every single day. How is this any different?
Those total strangers didn't abandon me when I was nine.
Look, I don't mean to sound cold, but is there really even a decision that needs to be made here?
I mean, that prognosis-- people don't generally recover from something like that.
Well, people don't generally survive rebar through their brain either.
But then they surprise you.
Touch√©.
The old trail should be right up there.
Park warden said they closed it down a few years back. Guess every once in a while they still get a thrill-seeker who ignores the signs.
They haven't been able to ping the phone?
Yeah. No contact since the call was dropped.
Cap.
Yeah.
Guess this is where he went over.
All right, everybody gear up.
Hen, Chimney, get the winch and the guidelines.
Prep a basket just in case.
I'm gonna radio Aerial Recon, have 'em on standby.
Copy that.
This is Captain Bobby Nash. T-118.
Aerial Recon to Abalone Cove in Palos Verdes.
DISPATCHER: Copy that, T-118.
(grunts) All right, big jump, Eddie. Come on.
Buck, Eddie, you guys see anything down there?
No.
Just a million-dollar view.
Cap, found something.
BOBBY: Is it our hiker?
(grunts) A hiker.
Don't think it's the one we came looking for.
It's human remains, Cap.
Skeletal remains.
All right. Well, flag it but don't disturb it.
We'll call it in.
Unless...
What, you think a ghost called 911?
I'm just saying.
IAN (in distance): Help!
Okay. So, no ghost.
BOBBY: What's going on down there, guys?
BUCK: Yeah, I think we heard something, Cap.
(Ian groaning) Easy, buddy. We're here.
BUCK: Hey, Cap, we got a live one.
Can you tell me your name?
(grunts) Ian.
Ian, okay. We're gonna get you out of here, okay?
My le-my leg is broken.
(groaning) All right, guys, we're gonna send a basket down to you.
How'd you find me?
It wasn't easy. You weren't on long enough for them to ping your phone.
On with who?
With, uh, with 911.
I dropped my phone when I went over.
I didn't call 911.
(groans) You guys still decorating those pumpkins?
How many are you making? (chuckles) Oh, and why so many ghosts?
Well, they're for Buck.
I'm gonna put 'em all over the firehouse.
Bobby says he thinks a ghost called 911.
BOBBY: Mm.
That'd be so cool if it did.
Well, Buck certainly thinks so.
But ghosts aren't real.
HARRY: Tommy Sheridan's family used to live in this apartment where this little old lady died, and he said the lights used to flicker when they used the tea kettle.
(Athena laughs) Didn't that building get red-tagged after the earthquake?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sounds more like faulty wiring than signals from the other side.
Harry, over 100 billion people have lived on this planet.
Pretty sure a little old lady has died everywhere.
Probably even in this very house.
(laughs) (stammers) All right. All right, all right, all right.
Enough of that, okay?
Your dad's coming to pick you up soon.
Why don't you guys go get your stuff ready.
Thanks for the help. I'll let you know how it goes.
Mm-hmm.
* They did the Monster Mash * The zombies were having fun...* A ghost called 911, huh?
Well, we were out on this call at Vista Point.
A hiker fell off a cliff.
I sent Buck and Eddie down to look for him, and they found bones.
Human?
Yeah.
We also found the hiker, alive, but he dropped his phone when he went over the edge, and now Buck is convinced that it was our skeletal friend who made the call.
Well, what do you think happened?
Eh, I think people like to go hiking on that trail even though they know they're not supposed to.
And somebody saw him go over and picked up his phone, used it to make the call so that nobody would know that they were there, too.
What do you know about the bones?
Well, not much. He'd been out there for a while.
He?
Yeah, there was this wedding band.
Based on the ring size, Eddie figured it must've been male.
Hmm. Vista Point.
Palos Verdes, right?
Yeah.
Why are you getting all detective on this?
This isn't your beat.
I'm a field sergeant.
I go where I want.
All right.
Athena Grant. Hey, Randy?
Yeah, how you doing?
I hear you guys caught a real cold case today.
What?
Mm-hmm.
You want to help me clean this up?
PRINCIPAL: Our grounds include two outdoor play areas, state-of-the-art gymnasium, music, theater, the full range of academic offerings, as well as behavioral and cognitive programs.
(chuckles) Look. Um...
The programs sound good, but Christopher's happiness is what's important to me.
I want him to feel normal, not like some special-needs charity case.
Every child is special. And, yes, some do have additional needs, but they're all equally our children.
They learn as much from each other as they do from us.
I think Christopher would be well cared for.
(chuckles softly) Okay. Let's do it.
The only thing left would be the family interview.
I'm sorry?
Oh, Christopher's terrific.
We have your information. All we need now is to meet Mrs. Diaz.
That won't be a problem, will it?
No, it's definitely a problem.
Look, I know Christopher's mother is a touchy subject with you, but I'm sure if we explain the situation to Principal Summers we can find a work around.
Do you have a copy of the custody agreement?
There isn't one.
We're still married.
(indistinct chatter) (woman screams) WOMAN: I don't understand why people would pay for this.
It's a bunch of guys in masks making minimum wage to say "boo." Hey, I'm paying just to laugh at you screaming.
(people shrieking) (music playing) Aah!
Whoa. Okay. (chuckles) Okay. Okay.
CHRIS: Oh, my God.
Uh, Chris, tell me you see those.
(growls) CHRIS: Damn, special effects are on point.
I don't think those are special effects.
(gasps) Oh...
Whoa.
(people screaming) CHRIS: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
(screaming continuing) Do we know if anybody was bitten?
You mean in like a Nosferatu, Count Whatever kind of way?
Listen, something like ten percent of bats are rabies carriers. If I got guys in there foaming at the mouth, I need to know.
I don't think. I mean, most of the injuries happened in the stampede out.
Anybody left inside?
A few stragglers, maybe.
But we got cast in there still trapped in their rigs.
Buck, Eddie, head around back, see if you can figure out the power situation.
We can't save what we can't see.
On it, Cap.
But, it's not a phobia, it's not even a fear.
It's just, rats and mice are way high up on my list of things that should absolutely not grow wings.
I mean, how does this happen?
Easy. These dumb-asses built a haunted house beneath their natural habitat during a damn mosquito epidemic.
Ah. Good job, boys.
Anybody back here?
Oh, thank God.
My boyfriend-- when the bats spooked, he ran face-first into the wall.
He hit his head pretty hard.
I'll say he did.
(Chris groaning) CHIMNEY: Got him.
Sir, can you sit up?
All right, here we go. (grunts) Sir, do you know what year it is?
Uh, 2018.
Can you tell me who the president is?
(chuckles) Come on, do I have to?
He'll be fine.
Athena. What are you doing here?
I heard about your, uh, ghost call.
Oh, God. Buck won't let it go.
I-It seems like the hiker that they rescued is gonna be okay.
Yeah. I'm actually here about the one who wasn't so lucky.
TERRY: I went back and did some digging.
I pulled any call that referenced Vista Point.
You're thinking what-- six, seven years ago?
Our skeleton had a cell. Pay as you go.
Untraceable, but, uh, the number was reassigned six years ago, so I thought that maybe that could narrow the search a little.
And that's all you have?
Well, that and this.
Initials on the inside of a band.
Six letters of the alphabet. Not much to go on.
Your cell phone lead might be.
I've got one here. October 29, 2011.
OPERATOR (on recording): 911. What's your emergency?
(radio static): HIKER (panting): Uh, I was hiking, fell off...
(grunts) The cliff gave out.
Can you-can you hear me?
OPERATOR: You're breaking up. What's your location?
No. That's not right. That sounds like my call from yesterday. Pull it up.
MADDIE (on recording): 911. What is your emergency?
(radio static) Uh, I-I can hear you, sir.
I'm here. Do you know where you fell?
I don't understand. There was a voice on the other end of the line.
What, same voice from seven years ago?
Yes.
So a ghost called 911?
He was down there for seven years.
I guess he got tired of waiting.
(quietly): So it was a ghost.
Why are you whispering?
(laughing); And what did I just say?
Yes, but your tech guy says it was some kind of glitch in the system.
(sighs) Turns out a bunch of the calls had weird static.
Okay, so how do you explain that it was the exact same call?
I said it sounded like the same call.
A lot of these calls sound the same.
Tell yourself that if it makes you feel better, but we both know a ghost called 911.
Okay.
You know, I keep thinking about the wedding ring.
I mean, you saw it, right?
How many nights someone was just waiting for news.
I heard somewhere a person is declared legally dead after they've been gone for seven years.
Yeah. I think you have to sign, like, a petition or something.
God, that is so awful.
Having to admit to the world that you've lost hope.
Well, seven years is a long time.
Probably lost hope way before that.
No one can wait forever.
Yeah, hope is a tricky thing.
Yeah, it keeps you going for a while, but...
at some point, if what you're hoping for is never gonna happen...
then it's just holding you back from your life.
Yeah, but it's hard to know, though, right?
If you're hanging on too long or...
if you're giving up too soon.
I think you do know.
It just may take you some time to admit it to yourself.
Well, at least it's neat.
HEN: I don't know if he even had a living will.
Doesn't look like there's a lot of money laying around for lawyers.
Well, you can find forms online.
Maybe that's what he did.
Mmm.
Uh...
I'll go check his desk.
* How's it going over there?
Babe, come look at this.
What, you found the will?
No.
It's that article the Times did on paramedics.
Oh, my God, with that awful photo of me?
I happen to love that photo of you.
This story is three years old.
How long has my dad been back here?
(knocking) Hi.
Hi.
Thanks for coming.
Yeah.
SHANNON: He's gotten so big.
(chuckles) Has...
he asked about me?
Not in a while.
He has a lot to keep him busy, though-- the move, new school, new city, new people.
Sure, sure.
Yeah. He must've been shocked when you said you were leaving Texas.
I sure was when you called yesterday.
Shannon...
So...tell me about this school.
They want to meet you. Well, need to meet you.
It's a requirement for admission.
It looks...fancy.
Not the kind of place I thought you'd be into.
Classes are smaller.
Ten kids instead of 30. Uh...
I mean, the art studio...
You should have seen him.
Can I?
See him?
I mean, this is a big step.
Switching schools when he just got here.
Maybe I could talk to him?
Make sure it's what he wants.
I don't think that's a good idea.
It...it might confuse him.
What's confusing?
I'm his mom.
Who he hasn't seen in almost two years?
My mother was sick. She was all alone.
I...You know why I had to go.
Yeah, but we were expecting you to come back.
And you didn't.
You could've come with me.
But you didn't want to leave Texas and your parents and your sisters, and...
At least not until it was something that was important to you.
That's not fair. I was trying to do what's best for Christopher.
Right.
Because Eddie always knows what's best for everyone.
I mean, God forbid you stop for a second and actually ask them what they need.
What did you need that I didn't give you?
You!
I needed a husband and a co-parent.
And instead, all I got was a life alone in Texas with a baby and you on another continent.
I needed someone to have my back.
I always had your back.
No.
You were in Afghanistan.
(door opens, closes) Thanks again for coming by.
Sometimes I like the quiet when Michael has the kids.
Other times, not so much.
(chuckles) Are these the remains we found the other day out in Palos Verdes?
Mm-hmm.
I'm trying to ID them.
You know, notify the next of kin, hopefully.
That's your job?
What, helping people?
I like to think so.
No, no, no. I mean, don't detectives do that?
I'm sure they're gonna drop all their hot cases where the victim just died and the clues are everywhere to find out what happened to a pile of bones just laying out in the open, forgotten.
I mean, I'm not saying they don't care.
They're just too busy.
So, did you run a DNA test?
Yeah, I set one up, but it's gonna take time.
Dental records will probably come back first.
Suddenly there's a rush?
Did I ever tell you about when I decided to become an officer of the law?
(sighs) I was nine years old.
Middle of the night.
I wake up and I see my father getting dressed.
Grabbing a flashlight, his gun.
I look out the window, and I see the whole neighborhood out there.
A little girl-- she was, uh, a grade behind me at school-- had gone missing.
Someone had just snatched her right out of her bed.
Nightmare.
They find her?
They found the barrette out of her hair out in the woods.
But that was it.
She was just gone.
My mother, she went over to the girl's parents' house twice a week, bringing food, that kind of thing.
I almost never saw them except at church.
That was the only time they went out.
But I remember how much they would change.
Just one week of not knowing where their baby was was enough to age them.
It was just six months or so before they were totally broken.
and I promised myself that when I was old enough I was gonna become a policewoman and find that little girl for those people.
Ease their pain.
Did you find her?
I did not.
But somebody...
loved this man.
You're thinking about your father?
He's the ghost that haunts my brain.
You any closer to figuring out what to do?
It shouldn't be such a struggle.
I think a part of me is hoping that he'll wake up...
so that I can meet him, finally.
I never even let myself...
imagine who this man was all these years.
It was just too...much pain to make him real in my mind's eye.
(crying): Which means that...
I've never hated him enough to feel good about pulling the plug on him.
Well, now at least you know he was a man haunted by his demons and channeling his own angels.
Like any of us.
(phone vibrating) I'll be damned.
Medical just got a hit.
You got a name?
Cal State Prison.
Alex Armando Perez.
He was just 22 years old.
He'd only been out six months.
(laughs) Are you some kind of pirate?
Snake Plissken?
Escape from New York?
Kurt Russell?
John Carpenter's masterpiece?
Oh, right, right. Well, I prefer Tango & Cash myself.
But you look cute, so I approve.
(laughs) Though I'm disappointed that costume didn't come with a smile.
I had a fight with Shannon.
When I asked her to help with Christopher and the school, she asked to see Christopher first.
And you said no? Okay, if you want her back in your life, you're gonna have to ease her back into it at some point.
Who said I want her back in my life?
Please.
So you decided to leave Texas, and you just so happened to choose a job working 30 minutes from where your ex lives?
LAFD are the best in the country.
In the world.
If she's gotten herself back together, you know what's best for your son.
And that's for his mother to be back in his life.
Sooner than later.
What if she screws up again?
Both of you have grown up a lot over the years.
And a boy needs his mama.
CHRISTOPHER: Daddy?
(growls) You know what, you're so cute, I could just rip you to shreds.
(both growling) (Carla laughing) * What's his name?
Hey. This is City Slicker.
He's a quarter horse.
Do you get to keep him?
No, he belongs to the police, but I get to take care of him and I train him on how to be a good police horse.
Would you like to feed him some apple?
(screaming) (neighing) Whoa...
Whoa!
MAN: ...got burned all over his face!
WOMAN: There's a horse running, and he looks really spooked!
POLICE OFFICER: Officer down. Repeat, we have an officer down.
Requesting immediate assistance.
* (low grunting) DAN: Easy, City.
He never gets spooked.
It was too many things at once.
I don't know if the air splint will fit his leg. I...
You know, may-maybe I can try and rig something.
It's not just his leg.
CHIMNEY: Should I radio for Animal Services?
It's gonna take them an hour to get here.
He's in pain.
Maybe the-the vet can fix it.
HEN: Horses are very prone to infection.
Their intestines don't respond well to antibiotics.
It's almost impossible for the immune response to work effectively.
How much does he weigh?
About a thousand pounds.
We don't have enough barbiturates on the truck to get it done.
He would need a sedative first.
Get it done?
Otherwise he would just thrash around like crazy till his heart gave out.
Are you sure you want to do this?
We-we could...we could try other things.
We both know they won't work.
He's a good boy.
I just don't want him to suffer anymore.
(City Slicker groans) (sniffles) It's okay, bud.
It's okay.
HEN: Administering sedative.
(whinnying) Thank you, buddy.
Thank you for keeping me company.
Thank you for keeping me safe.
Now you're gonna go to sleep, okay?
When you wake up, you're gonna be in a field of sage, and you can just run forever.
But you don't have to stay and watch anymore.
You don't have to be strong or calm or brave.
You can just be free.
(City Slicker groans) Just be a horse again.
Morphine.
(whispers): Bobby?
You want me to do it, Hen?
No, I got it.
(sighs) Hen.
(sighs) * (Dan sniffling) He's my friend.
He's my friend.
(kids chattering) (sighs) GIRL: Trick or treat!
(knocking) Alana Perez?
I'm Sergeant Grant. I'm here about Alex.
ALANA: When?
We identified his remains yesterday.
But it'd been awhile.
Seven years.
I saw your missing persons report.
They kept trying to tell me he'd run out on me.
That he'd gone back to his old life.
I'd get so...
mad.
Not that nobody believed me...
but that nobody believed in him.
There was no evidence of foul play.
It looks he was just hiking and the...
the road washed out beneath his feet.
The medical examiner will contact you about his remains.
In the meantime, I-I thought you might like to have this.
Mami, Mami, can we go now?
Yes, baby, of course. Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Thank you. Thank you.
Well, thank you for coming by, Mrs. Diaz. It was a pleasure to meet you.
You, too. Thank you.
You're welcome. Have a good day.
Hey.
Hey.
School called to tell me about your appointment.
Thought I'd head over.
Well, don't worry.
I didn't tank the interview, okay?
Least, I don't think I did.
I'm sure you did great.
I appreciate it. Christopher will, too.
That's why you're here-- to pass along thank-yous from my own son?
When you left...
I understood.
I tried to.
And you were taking care of your mother, and I was trying to take care of Christopher, and...
and we-we just drifted further away from each other.
But I always thought you'd come home.
Maybe we'd have a chance to make things right.
But you didn't.
So I guess I-I just...
I need to know.
Why?
I didn't know how.
I mean, the longer I was gone, the harder it was to come back.
To face you. And to face Christopher and...
He must hate me.
What are you talking about? Why would Christopher hate you?
Because I did this to him.
I have relived every moment of that pregnancy so many times, just trying to figure out how it happened, and...
what I did wrong.
And I thought I could make up for it, so I did all this research, finding new treatments and different therapies.
But it was all still so overwhelming and exhausting, and I just...
needed a break.
So then the mother who hurt her kid left him.
I'm sorry.
You didn't do anything wrong.
What happened...
wasn't your fault.
(sniffles) I...I know that.
I just...
I don't feel it.
Christopher loves you.
(chuckles softly) And he misses you.
I miss you.
I missed you.
* Everyone in my life-- my sister, the team-- they're on my side.
Now, what I really need right now is to talk to someone on Abby's side.
Okay, Buck, you know I don't do sides.
But you know...
I love both of you.
Yeah, but you know her.
All right, honestly, maybe even better than I do right now.
I, uh, haven't spoken to her in weeks.
The gap between talks keeps getting longer, and the conversations shorter.
There's this...this voice in my head keeps on saying...
"Move on, Buck.
She's never gonna come back." She still cares about you.
She's just not ready to come home yet.
At least not to this one.
Wait, what does that mean?
Her brother's been after her, you know, to come stay with them for a bit.
And truthfully, I think it'll be good for her.
I mean, she needs to go and dip her toe in the real world.
So, you know, she doesn't have a fear of being pulled under by all of these memories.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Everything in this place is hers.
She feels less and less a part of it every day.
See, this-this whole time, I-I felt like I was being haunted by this memory of her, but...
but maybe I'm the ghost.
Lingering here when...
when I should've moved on a long time ago.
You probably didn't know this, but when I was a little kid, I used to write you letters.
Mom said that we would mail them off as soon as we got your new address.
That never happened, but I kept writing.
I wrote about my Cabbage Patch dolls.
And the day I got inducted into the National Honor Society.
And that moment...
I saw my best friend and I...
I realized I wanted to kiss her.
You became like my diary.
Confessions to an imaginary daddy.
I don't know what you would've wanted, 'cause I don't know you.
I can only go off of what I would want.
And I wouldn't want to live like this.
Some ghost in a hospital bed.
So I'm gonna forgive you, Dad.
And let you...and let you go.
* And I'll use you as a warning sign...* BUCK: We are all haunted.
* Enough sense, then you'll lose your mind...* By the ones we've loved and the ones we've lost.
* And I'll use you as a focal point...* By the choices we've made and the ones we still struggle with.
* And I've moved further...* Our lives are like a series of ghost stories.
* But I missed you more * Than I thought I would * And I'll use you as a warning sign...* Sometimes all we can do is turn the page.
Let go.
(monitor flatlines) * And I found love * Where it wasn't supposed to be...* That's what I need to do now.
I'm not sure if you'll ever come back or how I'll feel if you do, but I am sure that I cannot wait anymore.
You are my ghost story, Abby.
You are the amazing spirit that blew into my life, turned it upside down, and then vanished into the night.
Being with you made me a better man, and for that I will always love you.
Now it's time for me to figure out who I am without you.
