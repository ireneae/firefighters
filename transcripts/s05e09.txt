How is it that every time the world seems to end, it ends some more?
"9-1-1" all new, Mondays.
This thing is holding on by a thread, Cap!
And watch other Fox shows, like "Our Kind of People," "The Big Leap," and "The Resident" on Fox.
You can do this, Gabi.
Just make a few turns and stops, park, and don't run over anyone.
Easy as can be.
Morning. My name is Chloe.
I will be your proctor for the road test portion of your California driving exam.
Hi.
 I'm Gabi.
 In your own time, Gabi.
Does that mean I should start?
We started when I got in the car, but it does mean your vehicle can move now.
Great.
Let me just secure my seatbelt.
<i>Just moved here from Brooklyn.</i> Take a right up here at Alvarado.
A right. Got it.
Never had to drive there, but I guess everyone here spends half their lives in their car.
Eyes on the road, please.
What are you writing down?
Is it about how I took my eyes off the road?
 I won't do that again.
 You were supposed to take a right.
Oh, crap. I'm sorry.
I've already failed, haven't I?
 The light.
 What?
 The light.
Definitely failed.
Again.
That's why I moved here, you know?
To the land of mandatory motor vehicles and terrible bagels and egg rolls that are really spring rolls.
Bad breakup.
She said I was weak and didn't know how to face my problems.
So I left town.
I'm not unaware that, in running away, I kind of proved her point.
Just keep moving.
Right. That's what I'm doing.
Trying to move on.
 Green light.
You did the right thing.
Okay, I swear I knew what a green light meant before I started this test.
No. I mean, moving out here.
Whoever she was, she's in your rearview now.
Thanks.
 That wasn't me.
You said "we." <i>Who else is in the car with you?</i> The woman from the DMV is in the passenger seat.
Her name's Chloe. I'm Gabi.
<i>I was taking my driver's test.</i>  Okay. Are either of you injured?
 I'm fine, but Chloe, she has a pen <i>-stuck in her chest.
 Is it deep?</i> I don't know.
What's deep when there's a pen in your chest?
 How does that even happen? Oh, God. <i>  Airbags.</i> Stay with me, Gabi. As long as that pen stays in, she should be okay. Is she conscious?
Yes.
 But she's having trouble breathing.
That can't be good, right?
<i>-The pen might've punctured her lung.
 Should I...</i> do something?
Just keep an eye on her and stay on the line.
Fire and rescue are arriving now.
<i>Dispatch, this is Captain Nash.</i> 118. Please advise DWP to shut <i>the power off on this street.</i> <i>Have them contact CalGEM to send a team of engineers</i> <i>to cap this well.</i> What is the status of our victims?
<i>Gabi, the driver, appears uninured,</i> but it sounds like her passenger, Chloe, might have a brachial puncture wound.
 How's her breathing?
 Described as labored.
<i>Copy that.</i> Okay, Ravi, I want you to start foaming this area.
We don't want any accidental sparks igniting this oil.
<i>How we doing in there, Gabi?</i> I think her breathing's worse.
Are they getting us out?
They're working on it.
See if we can get that hatch open.
Help! Get us out!
Ah, it's jammed. Give me the Jaws. Come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, negative, negative.
Buck, stop. Stop.
We're on top of an oil well.
Isn't that why we have the foam?
No, the foam is just a Band-Aid.
It's good for a spark or two, but we start cutting into metal, this whole thing's gonna go.
Ask the driver how her breathing sounds.
<i>Any gurgling or choking?</i> Gabi, can you tell me how Chloe's breathing sounds?
<i>Any gurgling?</i> I'm not sure.
I can't hear anything in here.
Can you move in closer?
Seat belt.
Gonna...
have to...
dock you...
Oh, jokes. Guess you're feeling better.
Uh-huh.
<i>Caller says there's a little gurgling.</i> Hey.
We shatter the back of the glass, then go in.
No sparks with glass.
But we got to cut through the seats to get to them, and again...
Tools and sparks.
 Yeah.
 What if we, uh, we shatter the moonroof?
You know, we pull them up and out.
No, no, no. Look at the flow of that geyser.
 We bust that glass, they're gonna drown in oil. Hey! Hey!
One of them has a sucking chest wound.
If we don't get them out, she's gonna drown in her own blood.
 We can't wait.
 We need someone to cap that well.
Well, maybe we cap it ourselves.
Let's go.
You didn't...
What?
Run.
Still... here.
Where would I go? I don't have a license.
Oh!
 Oh! Oh, my God! Oh!
<i>-No! Chloe!
 Gabi? What's happening?</i> The pen fell out. She's bleeding, bad.
Okay. I need you to apply pressure to the wound.
You have anything in the car, like <i>-a clean cloth?
 Um, I...</i>  Napkins. <i>  Great.</i> <i>Just wad them all up and make a pad.</i> <i>Then hold it against the wound and apply direct pressure.</i> Tight. We just need to slow down the bleeding.
 For how long? <i>  Fire and rescue will be able to get to you in just a minute.</i>  Okay. <i>  They just need to move your car.</i> Okay-- What? Move it where?
Come on, everybody. Let's go. Let's push.
All right, let's push, let's go.
Everybody push.
Push!
It's going, it's going. Push, guys, push.
That's it. Let's go. Push, push, push.
Keep going. That's it.
Push. Push. That's it. Keep going. Yeah.
<i>What happens now?</i> <i>They're gonna break the sunroof,</i> so I need you both to shield your eyes.
Okay. We're ready.
Glass breaking. Three, two, one.
It's okay, Chloe. Help is here. You're gonna be okay.
 Bag. All right.
 Yeah.
 Let's get you out of there.
 No. I'm fine.
Help her first. She's not talking anymore.
We save you, and we can get in here and save her.
All right, take my arm.
All right. I got you.
Definitely a deep puncture.
Pulse is still strong. Eddie, I'm gonna need a...
Three-sided dressing, coming up.
Damn it.
The oil wants out.
Our weight's the only thing keeping it contained.
Ready to move.
Hen. Hen, we got to go! Come on.
Let's go, let's go.
I hope she's insured.

May! What are you doing here?
I'd ask the same question, but I really don't want to know the answer.
You yearned for the freedom of your own apartment, why aren't you there?
I had to come get my mail.
Have you never heard of a Change of Address form?
Definitely about to look into it.
I don't want to disturb whatever situation this is, so I'm gonna go get my mail.
Oh, oh, not in here, not in here.
What are you wearing?
Uh, it's just all I could find in the kitchen to cover up.
So you weren't wearing-- No.
I'm just gonna stop myself right there.
I just had to clear the counters off before we... I think the mail's in the bedroom.
 I'll get it. Uh, May, could you...

Thank you.
 Where's Harry? Went to the movies.
I can't find it.

There's over 5,000 known oil wells in L. A., but there are a bunch that were just basically forgotten.
You know, they-they dried up, they filled them with trash and covered them.
It's like the-the ticking time bomb that could be sitting in your backyard right now.
Uh, Tay?
 Taylor.
 Huh?
Oh, I-I was just, uh, I was pitching you a great story.
Uh, I-I did the-the promo tease.
Yeah. I, uh...
Big, um...
oil well... time bombs.
It's great.
Hey, are-are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm just tired.
Haven't really slept well in the last few days.
I should go home.
Maybe I'm just sleep-deprived enough to actually get  a full night's rest.
 Uh, well-well...
Hold on. Wh-Why don't you, uh, why don't you stay here?
You don't need to drive all the way across town just to sleep.
Stay here. I'll-I'll make you breakfast in the morning, and, yes, by make I mean I'll put some frozen waffles in the toaster.
Sorry. Um...
Waffle rain check?
Yeah. Sure.
 Good night.
 Good night.
<i>I think it's over.</i> <i>-Uh, me and Taylor.</i> She went home to get some sleep.
How is that code for it's over?
Well, what's past is prologue, right?
And, based on my past, Taylor and I have reached the point in a relationship where the woman flees.
Women flee you?
 Routinely?
Starts out small. Uh, she's-she's canceling plans.
She's got to work. She needs to wash her hair or do her laundry, and before you know it, poof.
Dropping them off at the airport and never seeing them again.
Okay, Buck, you're being a little too Buck about this.
A little? When was the last time a woman told you she had to go home to wash her hair? 1952?
Listen, Taylor is not Abby or Ally. It doesn't even rhyme.
I mean, that's a good sign, right?
The thing is...
I-I think she might've been living with me.
I mean, we never explicitly said that, but she's there all the time.
I... It sure feels like we were living together.
Why does this keep happening to you?
Well, to be honest, I think...
No. I'm gonna tell you why.
Because you don't talk to the women you're dating.
You just go with the flow and find yourself in a relationship with no idea how you got there or what to do when things start to go wrong.
Yeah. Who does that?
My point is, breaking up is not inevitable.
You can turn it around.
You just have to make the effort.
Talk to Taylor. Tell her how you're feeling.
Find ways to reconnect.
Cap knows of what he speaks.
Apparently, May walked in on him and Athena reconnecting in the kitchen the other night.
Oh, God. Parental nightmare.
Well, apparently, my wife has been oversharing.
I mean, I just wasn't aware that we were able to bring our gear home for recreational purposes.
 Aw...
You've been playing sexy firefighter, Cap?
What makes you think that I was the firefighter?
Oh, come on.
I don't want to think about that, and... now I can't stop.
Tejada.
 You called it in?
 Yeah. I was driving by, and I saw the hood up, and that's when I saw him.
He was breathing, but he didn't respond  when I tried to talk to him.
 Trying to charge his engine.
Looks like he gave himself a shock.
He must've fallen and hit his head.
Sir, can you hear me?
Sir, can you hear me?
I'm with the LAFD.
You took a pretty nasty fall, so...
we're gonna just check you out, okay?
Antonia?
Pupils are equal and reactive.
BP is stable.
Sir, what's your name?
Clive Wexler.
Do you know where you are?
Flat on my back in the driveway in front of my house, unfortunately.
Wilson. Antonia Wilson?
What year is it?
 That's usually our question. Well...
Antonia Wilson is my mother, but...
though I don't think I've ever heard anyone call her by that name.
Antonia's daughter?
 You two know each other?
 Knew.
She and I were friends.
Good friends, when we were younger, but I haven't seen her since...
got to be over 40 years ago now.
Doesn't seem to be fractured.
Let's cover the wound and transport him to the hospital.
So you and my mom were close?
I certainly thought so, but if I know Toni, she wouldn't want me discussing her personal business,  even with her own daughter.
Especially with her own daughter.
Antonia was always a snappy dresser.
Her coat of armor was her favorite piece, if you know what I mean.
I understood, though.
You catch enough shrapnel and, eventually, you don't want to leave any part of yourself exposed.
So, if you knew my mom back then, then you probably knew my dad, too.
He was the shrapnel.

They really shouldn't have called you.
It's not a big deal.
Caller said something about $1 million missing.
Well, yeah, but you guys are about 30 years too late.
The robbery happened in 1987?
Guy held up one of our blackjack tables, made off with a million two in chips, sped away on a motorcycle, and was never heard from again.
And I'm here why?
Someone tried to cash one of the stolen chips this morning.
Who?
Pretty sure this face wasn't even born in '87.
'94.
 Neil...
"Bee-sco..."  Biscobing.
Rhymes with "disco king." Sorry. Old family joke.
If you say so.
Explain the chip, Neil.
Well, I'm a bell-ringer for Santa's Helping Hand, and someone must've put it in my bucket.
Didn't see who.
Didn't even notice the chip until I was on my lunch break.
And then you decided to try and cash it.
It'd feed thousands of families.
You said that no one ever saw the robber's face.
Any chance you saw the rest of him on one of your cameras inside?
Maybe it will jingle Kris Kringle's memory.
We wouldn't have that footage anymore.
Everything would've been turned over to the police in '87.
And I'm sure your people have already tossed it in the trash by now.
You'd be surprised how inefficient we are.
Neil, write down your number.
If I find the robber, you might remember him.
Clive Wexler.
I'm surprised you don't remember him, 'cause he sure remembered you.
I remember Clive.
It was just a long time ago.
Where'd you even meet him?
On a case.
Yeah, a police officer found him unconscious in his driveway.
Is he all right?
Mm-hmm. He's fine.
He was just fixing an old convertible and shocked himself, so he ended up with a bump on the head.
He still has that car?
He said you two went way back.
He wasn't that forthcoming, though, with the details on how you knew each other.
You know, from the neighborhood.
I'm home.
 Sorry I'm late.
 Oh, let me help you with that.
Ah, thank you. Kids not in?
Karen took Harry and Denny to get some ice cream.
 Oh. What about May?
 Uh, said she couldn't make it.
Scarred for life.
What's up with the box?
Uh, evidence from an old cold case.
Actually, it's why I called you here.
I need a consultant.
Me?
Someone robbed The Fairwell Casino.
 When? I didn't hear about that.
 1987.
And they got away?
They usually don't make it out the front door.
Usually don't make it out with all their teeth, either.
Let me get you some wine.
Thank you, baby.
 Thanks.
 So how much are we talking?
A million in chips.
Guy in a motorcycle helmet came in, drew a gun on the dealer, then cleared them out.
How many tables did he hit?
Well, as far as I know, just the one.
That's a lot of money for one table.
When I was a dealer, we used a 12 barrel tray with 60 chips per barrel.
Depending on the time of day, I might have anywhere from...
a hundred grand to half a mil at my table.
Hmm. It was 8:00 a. m. on a Wednesday.
Must've been a special request from a high roller.
It's not uncommon, but, usually, somebody has to sign off on a request.
Hmm, y'all do that a lot at casinos?
If we know them? Sure.
A fool and his money are soon parted.
 And it's our job to make that parting as easy as possible.
Savage.
A million dollars.
Don't get too excited.
Even if I find it,  we can't keep it.
 Yeah.
It's an interesting mystery, though.
A masked man gets away with a million dollars.
Never seen or heard from ever again.
And the chips never turned up, either?
Not until today.
Wait a minute. D. B. Cooper only made away with 200,000, and how many books and documentaries have there been about him?
And yet we've never heard of this biker bandit?
Ooh, I like that. Catchy.
Casinos pride themselves on their security.
Can't have people thinking it's like knocking over a 7-Eleven.
Damn, Ma. You really know everything about casinos.
I worked there.
And maybe our thief did, too.
Uh, hey.
 You're here.
 Hi.
I, uh, thought you said, like, an hour ago you couldn't come over tonight.
Uh, I was looking for my tablet. I think I left it here.
Uh, yeah.
Uh...
Ah. Thank you.
Uh, why don't you stay for dinner?
Uh, can't. Got an early flight in the morning.
Hey, wh-what's going on?
First you're in here sneaking around trying to grab your stuff, and now you're...
you're skipping town?
I'm not skipping town, Buck.
Taylor, if you're gonna break up with me, then just...
Who said anything about breaking up?
It's just for a day or two.
We can talk about it when I get back.
No!
No, I'm sorry, but we-we can't.
We're gonna talk about it now, 'cause if you're gonna be weird and distant, and then just take off, you cannot expect me not to worry.
At least tell me where you're going.
My father's parole hearing.
<i>I was the one who found her.</i> The coroner ruled it a suicide.
Then, eight months later, they came back and arrested my father.
So your dad killed your mom.
Well, that's what the second jury said.
The first one was a little more split on their feelings.
And what about your feelings?
A much more complicated story.
He's my dad.
There's a part of me that could never believe he could have done this.
But it's not like I can imagine my mother doing that to herself.
So you just spent all these years not knowing?
Everybody had a theory.
My mom's family, my dad's family.
Living in between the two was pretty... messy.
And now I have to go in front of a parole board and convince them that he's a good person who deserves a second chance.
Whoa, hey, there's gotta be a way for us to find out what really happened.
You know, maybe we could, uh, we could take another look at the case.
You think I haven't?
I have talked to family, friends, investigators.
It all came back to the same place.
Only two people know what really happened.
And one of them is dead.
 And the other one?
 Swears he's innocent.
Wait, well, let me come with you at least.
You know, I can get a plane ticket, and...
No.
I don't want that.
This isn't your childhood trauma, Buck, it's mine.
I need to deal with this on my own.
Bobby.
 What are you doing up?
 You gotta check this out.
No, no, no, no, I'm not checking anything out.
Come to bed. Those tapes will be there in the morning.
 It'll only take a second. Come on.
 No, no.
 Okay, here he is right after he hit the table.
 Mm-hmm.
Now, security scrambles as soon as they know  that there's a robbery happening, right?
 Mm-hmm.
Here they are, right on his heels.
 As they should be.
 But now, watch this.
 Oh...
 Here he is, seconds after.
Where are the guards?
 Exactly.
Run that back.
How'd he get such a huge lead?
That is the $1.2 million question.
You still think it was an inside job?
Well, Toni said someone would have to approve the extra chips on the table,  so security probably knew.
 Look at them stop there.
 I mean, maybe they did do it on purpose.
 Inside job.
Eliminate the impossible, and only the improbable remains.
Oh, yeah. O-Okay, Sherlock.
 All right, run that back.
No, no, no, no, no. Come on.
Mm, I don't suppose there's any way you could fix that.
Well, I mean, I could try to piece it together, but...
Mm-mm.
Or, there is another way we could test our theory.
What other way?
Rob the casino.
<i>"From the neighborhood"?</i> Yep. That's all she said.
Like he was some guy she used to see on the corner or something.
She used to definitely see him, all right.
Right?
I wasn't just imagining that.
Clive and Toni were definitely a thing.
And I mean, like, big time, long-lost-love kind of thing.
My abuela would eat this up. She loves a good telenovela.
Oh, 'cause, uh, 'cause you don't?
Come on, I know you watch 'em with Christopher.
That's how we practice our Spanish.
 Uh-huh.
 Real question is, what happens next in the story?
Well, I-I do have his number.
I could call him.
I mean, just to see how he's doing after his fall.
 Of course.
 Whoa, hold on, you don't know why they broke up, right?
I mean, I mean, what if there's some deep trauma that shouldn't be poked at?
Since when did you become the voice of reason?
 Did something happen with Taylor?
 Uh, no, you just-- You guys were right, she's not breaking up with me.
That's all you're giving us? We still got... Oh.
 Okay.
 Three minutes?!
 Whoo!
How the hell did you manage to shave almost three minutes off of Buck's best coffee run time?
It's called a mobile order, Hen. Walked in and the drinks were waiting.
This just better be oat milk.
Damn it, he even got the order right.
<i>Club sodas,</i> shaken, not stirred.
For you I get, but for me?
 We're working here.
 Are we?
'Cause it feels a little more like we're playing.
Not to say that I mind.
I'm gonna need a little vodka  in this club soda.
 Yes, miss.
So the high rollers were over here.
There was over a million dollars' worth of chips right over there.
And from what I remember about the tape, security was way over there.
 Hmm.
 All right, let me have your purse.
Oh. It doesn't really go with that outfit.
You don't think?
Okay, I'm the biker bandit, you're security.
You take your position, and as soon as I grab this, you come after me, and I'll try and escape.
We are taking this role-playing a little more public than necessary.
We retrace his steps, we'll figure out how the bandit got away.
 If you say so.
 Just remember, it's not so much about the speed as it is about the distance.
So if you match my pace, it should work out.
 Then let's play.
 Let's play.
♪ <i>All this talking, not much doin'♪</i> ♪ <i>People screaming, not much doin'♪</i> ♪ <i>I get tired of all this play...♪</i>  You didn't run.
 I matched your pace.
All right, let's do it again.
♪ <i>I'm driving down the same old track♪</i> ♪ <i>Too much weight on my back</i>♪  Let's do it again.
♪ <i>I'm at the end of the road</i>♪ ♪ <i>So brother, lighten my load.</i>♪ Okay, all right, it happens right around here every time in this blind spot, so why didn't security catch him?
Because he doubled back.
Valet and the motorcycle is over there.
And somehow he was able to leapfrog them somewhere in here and head out that door.
 Mm-hmm.
 I mean, the only other possibility is that door.
I just don't see how he could make it from there to there.
Bobby, there's an entire racetrack and grandstand out there.
Now, he could have jumped over the seats  and doubled back out there.
 Miss? Here you go.
Thank you.
The fire extinguishers.
I can't believe I didn't catch this before. Look.
Per code, they have to be three feet off the ground.
Now, on his way in, our biker bandit looks to be  about six feet tall.
 Mm-hmm.
But when he leaves...
The robber is shorter going out than when he came in?
He didn't double back, he had a double.
 What do you think, like, five seven, five eight?
 Yeah.
Sergeant Grant.
Didn't think you were working this case anymore.
This is my husband, Bobby Nash.
 Just wanted to show him the place.
 Mm.
Yeah, she was telling me all about your biker bandit.
 My what?
 The thief.
Just a little name I came up with for him.
Did you work here then?
 I did. I was a dealer.
 Oh.
But not that morning. I was in class.
Business school. Student by day, blackjack dealer by night.
And now you're running the place.
Well, I didn't want to stand at a table forever.
Well, listen, while you're here, you should check out the restaurant.
We'd be happy to comp you both a nice meal, a nice bottle of wine...
 Oh, well...
 That's kind. Very kind.
But we couldn't accept.
Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me.
 Well, that was interesting.
 Hmm.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Five seven.
Maybe five eight.
Biscobing. Rhymes with "disco king."  You remembered.
 Not a common name.
I ran across it again this morning.
There was a Jimmy Biscobing that was a regular at the Fairwell back in '87.
That was my uncle.
He passed away weeks ago from stomach cancer.
Sorry for your loss.
He gave you the chip before he died?
I found it as my dad and I were cleaning out his place.
That's not all I found.
 Jimmy.
 You two were a thing?
No one knew.
The bosses frowned on employees dating players.
Probably afraid you'd give them inside information?
Like how to rob a casino, for instance?
There needed to be two of you.
<i>One for the guards to chase out front,</i> <i>and another to slip out the back with the money.</i> It wasn't like we were stealing; the casino got the chips back.
Cashing out.
<i>We tossed the high-value chips. We knew those were</i> <i>too easy to trace.</i> Sorry, forgot one.
<i>We split the rest.</i> <i>I used my share to finish school,</i> <i>get my MBA, move up in the company.</i> <i>And Jimmy's share?</i> Player busts.
<i>They got that back, too.</i> Am I under arrest?
There isn't anything we can do legally about it at this point.
Believe me, I looked.
But I did speak with your employers.
Did they really have to know?
I could have retired early, kept it quiet.
And I don't really do quiet.
Buck?
I told you not to come.
Uh, you know me.
I don't always listen.
Are you okay?
No.
I couldn't do it.
Stand up and say he deserves a second chance when...
I'm not sure he does.
Uh, well, that-that must have been really hard.
Like, kind of brave, though.
You know? Uh...
To admit how you, how you really feel.
He told me I was a terrible daughter.
After everything he'd done for me and...
... how he'd always been there for me,  and I was letting him down.
 No. Hey, hey, hey, you're not.
You're not, okay?
You were doing what was right for you.
And if he can't understand that...
Maybe you should have talked to him.
Guess we both came all this way for nothing.
There are no answers here.
That's not why I came.
I'm only here for you.
In case you needed me.
Haven't been here in forever.
Hasn't really changed much at all.
Did you used to, uh, come here a lot?
I don't remember that.
Way before your time.
So, what's going on?
I know you didn't bring me out for pizza alone just because.
What's this terrible news you're about to spring on me?
It's not terrible, it's just...
Hello, Antonia.
Clive.
These are for you.
It's good to see you again, Antonia.
Thank you.
You look well.
Not as good as I looked 30 years ago, but, then again, time does that to a man.
Well, would you like to join us, Clive?
I can find us a...
Enough, Henrietta. I'm not staying.
I'm sorry, Clive, but... you came here for nothing.
 Antonia...
 I'm-I'm so sorry.
Let me go talk to her.
Mom! Ma, are you okay?
 I-I, I didn't mean to...
 Yes, you did!
It's who you are.
 You can never leave well enough alone.
 No, I just...
The past is the past for a reason, Henrietta.
It's best to just leave it there.
Ah...
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
 About my parents.
Well, that's okay.
I, too, understand a complicated family dynamic that's hard to put into words.
After he went to prison, I went to live with my aunt.
I'd meet new people, and there was always this moment.
This look that would come across their face when they realized who I was.
It was like, you know, I could see what they were thinking.
"Oh... you're that girl." So when you got old enough, you moved to a place where no one knew that girl.
I tell other people's stories for a living because I hate telling my own.
Hey...
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
You okay, Ma?
I'm fine.
Are you still upset with me for, uh...
for meddling?
Just feeling a little melancholy.
That's pictures of you and me.
And Dad, not so much.
I'd like to say that was because he was the one with the camera.
But you and I both know that's not true.
He was never there, even when he was.
It was an affair, Henrietta.
Me and Clive.
While I was married to your father.
You're not surprised.
You storming off when the man was trying to give you flowers was a clue.
Last time I saw Clive was 1978.
He asked me to run away with him.
You were gonna leave Dad?
I knew it was wrong, but...
when Clive talked about the future we could have together...
I saw it...
and I wanted it with my whole heart.
But the day I was supposed to meet him, I...
Stood him up.
 I had my reasons.
 W-Why?
Why would you...
Wait. 1978.
Oh, Ma.
Me?
The doctor called the morning we were supposed to go.
I was willing to leave my husband, but I couldn't walk out on the father of my child.
I mean, are you-- Are you even sure that Dad  was-was-was...
 Henrietta.
This ain't <i>Maury Povich.</i> Yes. I'm sure.
What's this?
Clive's number.
I wasn't sure if I should risk your wrath again giving it to you, but...
 now...
 Honey, I think Clive and I are well past our expiration date.
You don't know that.
Maybe the future that you glimpsed back then, maybe it's now, Ma.
And all you need to do is step into it.
You're not...
ashamed of me?
No.
I know that things were never good with Dad, and that you were alone and unhappy for a long time, Ma.
So I'm not ashamed.
I'm just glad that somebody loved you before I did.
Thank you.
 Hey. We're over here.
What are you doing?
Gin. And I'm winning.
Come on. Two out of three.
You just don't know when to quit, do you?
 Well, it's good to see you two...
 What?
Doing old married couple stuff, like playing cards?
 Mm. And solving crime. Mm-hmm.
 We're pretty good at that.
Oh, uh, this is yours.
It got mixed up with my mail the other day.
I got that change of address filed, so you should stop getting my mail soon.
May, you are welcome to stop by anytime.
 With some advance notice. Yep.
I got it. Well, I'm meeting a friend for dinner,  so I'm gonna take off.
 All right, well, have fun.
 Okay, bye. You, too.
 Bye.
Are we having fun?
Oh, we are about to.
 Hi.
 Hi.
Um, I'm not sure what you remember.
You saved my life.
Thank you for that.
My pleasure.
So you're sure you're not mad at me for showing up in Oklahoma?
Well, honestly,  I kind of love you for it.
 Great, 'cause...
What? Hey!
Don't make it weird.
I love you.
Good.
I love you, too.
