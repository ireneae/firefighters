Okay, you've officially reached Fort Knox-level security.
Oh, you think it's too much?
Three motion sensors in the living room?
I mean, maybe if you're trying to keep Tom Cruise from getting his hands on your NOC list.
Mission: Impossible. No?
Sorry, haven't seen it.
Travesty.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Maybe we pop the hinges off the door.
Or we use the Jaws of Life.
No, no, no. It has to fit. I measured it twice.
Can't you guys just, you know, turn it around the other way?
And then the pizza will slide off.
You have pizza on my new sofa?
It's on the plastic.
Okay.
I'm sorry. You were showing me the security app.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: All right, pivot. (<em>Grunts</em>)
Okay, so, basically, you can check everything on here.
(<em>Grunting</em>)
Lift with your legs.
And you can also check it on your phone if you're not at home.
That's great 'cause now if I hear a noise in the middle of the night, I don't have to get out of bed to know it's the ice maker.
Hey, thank you, guys, for helping me on your day off.
Don't worry about it. Plates?
Countertop.
Kitchen.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Beer?
Uh, also kitchen, fridge.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Clever.
He is so cute.
Yeah, he gets that a lot. Uh, you should meet his kid, though.
Wait, Chimney has a kid?
No, I-I thought you meant...
Chimney?

(<em>Sirens wailing</em>)
Hey, stay down! Stay down!
<strong>Man</strong>: Get out of here.
<strong>Woman</strong>: Keep 'em back.
The pilot radioed they were having mechanical trouble.
Looks like he tried to put it down in the field over there.
Yeah, it got close.
Yeah, not close enough. Get down, people, move!
Move! Go!
All right, guys, we're gonna fan out, go behind those bleachers.
Eddie, after we get the people out, you think you can kill that engine?
Think so, I'm just worried about the dynamic rollover.
The dynamic what?
We change the weight ratio by pulling people out, whole thing could tip over, rotors could snap off.
And then flying rocks are gonna be the least of our problems.
All right, visors down. Let's go!
Buck, get her out of there.
On it, Cap.
Put your arms around me.
Yes. All right, here we go.
Okay.
Ah!
(<em>Shouting</em>)
Got to keep it moving.
All right.
All right, on three. One, two, three.
Pulse/ox is good. We can get rid of this.
How are you doing?
I'm not sure.
How's Trent? Is he okay?
Your pilot's gonna be just fine.
Hey, do me a favor. Uh, say, &quot;And on the 405, speeds are under five miles an hour, making your morning commute a rough one.&quot;
Seriously?
I-I-I know that voice.
It's, uh, it's Taylor Kelly reporting, right?
Right. Skywitness News Eight.
That's me.
<strong>Buck</strong>: Wow. Um, it's, uh, it's weird to hear that voice come out of a face.
Thank you?
Um, you have helped me beat traffic in this city more times than you will ever know.
Oh, you might want to Uber tomorrow.
(<em>Chuckles</em>)
Uh...
<strong>Priest</strong>: For justice and peace in the world, and that our leaders may be illuminated by the grace of God.
We pray to the Lord.
<strong>Congregation</strong>: Lord, hear our prayer.
<strong>Priest</strong>: And for the repose of the soul of Brook Nash.
We pray to the Lord.
<strong>Congregation</strong>: Lord, hear our prayer.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: She would've turned 13 today.
<strong>Priest</strong>: Is it hard to reconcile that with the image you still have of her in your mind?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Yeah.
Especially around her birthday.
Brook's very last school project was a show-and-tell with her dad, the &quot;hero.&quot;
She was so proud of me.
I believe she's proud of you now.
I hope so, Father. I really hope so.
(<em>Sighs</em>)
<strong>Taylor</strong>: This is fantastic.
I love it. We need to capture it all.
Real life inside a firehouse.
Please, God, tell me there's a Dalmatian around here somewhere.
Excuse me.
Captain Nash, I'm Taylor Kelly.
We met the other day when...
I know who you are, Ms. Kelly.
I just don't understand what you're doing here.
Please don't film in here.
Uh, why not?
Because it's-it's rude.
Oh, they didn't call you yet.
Who?
<strong>Firefighter</strong>: Captain, Chief's office on the line.
Uh, Taylor Kelly?
(<em>Chuckles</em>) Wh-What are you doing here?
You can just call me Taylor. Uh, how was your drive in?
Did you miss me?
My morning definitely wasn't the same without you.
(<em>Chuckles</em>) I...
Hey, how're you feeling?
Any side effects after the crash?
I'm great.
Thanks to all of you, which is why I'm here. You guys were so amazing.
I want to do a story on this firehouse and on the heroes who work here.
Yeah, but you do traffic.
I'm not quite ready to go back in the sky, so I thought I'd try my hand at telling a story from the ground.
And use your newfound fame to put your face in front of the camera.
That, too.
Smart girl.
I can't wait to interview all of you.
I want to know why you chose this job, the crazy things you've seen, what it's like to face death.
I mean, Howie, you almost died, right?
Actually, nobody calls me that. It's Chimney.
I bet there's a story there.
Hmm.
Not one you can tell on TV.
(<em>Taylor chuckles</em>)
Well, you must've really impressed the chief.
He said to give you whatever access you need.
Don't worry, Captain Nash, your story's in good hands.
I'm gonna make you all famous.
<strong>Taylor</strong>: Tell us about althis.
Oh. This table is all about the love.
It's, uh, tokens of appreciation from the people we serve.
Baked goods are big, and cards, we love the cards.
Mmm, and carbs. We love carbs.
But this stuff is what really keeps us going, the love.
Mmm, and the carbs.
And the carbs.
What made me want to become a firefighter?
That's a great question.
Short answer: I got shot.
Well, to be honest, I, um, I just kind of fell into it.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: What I missed most after leaving the Army is the camaraderie, um, working shoulder-to-shoulder with a great team, and there's none better than the one I found here.
I mean, what little kid doesn't want to be a firefighter?
Especially... a hot firefighter.
That's for you. Go ahead.
<strong>Hen</strong>: The bullet wasn't meant for me, um...
I was 16 years old, walking home from school, and I hear this &quot;pop, pop, pop.&quot;
And next thing, I feel this penetrating pain just throw me to the ground.
The stray bullet had entered my back, ruptured a kidney, and, uh, grazed my aorta.
I was dying.
And then someone yelled, &quot;Call 911.&quot;
And I guess someone did because the next thing you know, I was in the back of an ambulance, and these two paramedics were working on me and just telling me to stay with them.
You know, their skill kept me from dying, but the way they cared for me... that's what kept me alive.
<strong>Taylor</strong>: Yeah, let's go see if we can grab him. Come on.
Captain Nash.
Can we have a few minutes with you?
Um...
(<em>Alarm ringing</em>)
<strong>Man (<em>over P.A.</em>)</strong>: Attention, Station 118.
Engine and rescue. Got a report of adult male, difficulty breathing.
(<em>Sirens wailing</em>)
I was told there's a man here who's choking to death.
No, uh, Gregory says he doesn't want any help now.
Okay, excuse me, ma'am.
Wonder how many he put down.
Joey Chestnut scarfed down 74 hot dogs in ten minutes at last year's Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.
Excuse me, sir, are you refusing care?
(<em>Hissing</em>)
Ah, geez!
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Whoa.
Cute.
That thing yours?
That's Claude. He's the grand prize.
(<em>Groaning</em>)
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Whoa, guys, guys.
Get them in. Give us some room.
Get this table and chairs out of here.
That means you guys, too. Give us some room. Back up.
Prep the defib.
<strong>Hen</strong>: Airways are sealing up.
I need the BBM.
What was this, like, a pepper eating contest?
No. Protein.
His pulse is thready.
(<em>Chirping</em>)
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Locusts!
Oh, whoa.
<strong>Sandy</strong>: No, they're actually crickets.
We allowed anything that Claude would eat.
We thought it might be fun.
His pulse is weakening. He's in V-fib.
He's coding.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Starting compressions.
Damn it, the blockage is too big.
He's not getting any air. Let me try something.
Come on, buddy.
Buck, give me the Magill.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Come on.
Come on, come on.
Oh, my God.
Right here, man.
Ugh.
I got it.
(<em>Gasps</em>)
(<em>Exhales loudly</em>)
He's back.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: I got sinus rhythm, pulse action's rising. Let's get him up.
(<em>Retching</em>)
Try to breathe.
All this for a lizard, huh?
A monitor lizard, and 500 bucks.
And I just lost.
(<em>Mouth full</em>): Yes, you did! Yeah!
(<em>Cheering</em>)
Almost.
<strong>Man</strong>: Oh, roaches, dude.
Oh! Eat the roaches.
Yes, eat it.
(<em>Retches</em>)
<strong>Man</strong>: Yes!
Claude, I guess you're staying with me.
(<em>Hissing</em>)
(<em>Gasps</em>)
(<em>Laughs</em>): Oh.
I guess he likes you. He likes redheads.
Ah.
(<em>Laughs</em>): Come on.
I just don't like her.
You don't like the intrusion?
I don't. I don't like cameras in the firehouse.
I certainly don't like them on calls.
Makes it harder for us to do our job.
Well, unfortunately, that's the reality nowadays.
Cameras everywhere.
Body cams, phone cameras, CCTVs.
Big Brother is definitely watching.
No, I'm more worried about Little Sister.
Are you gonna be on TV?
Not if I can help it.
Doesn't May like short ribs?
(<em>Laughs</em>)
Well, it might have something to do with that story you told at mealtime.
Oh.
No, she's on a stupid diet.
Wha... still?
I told her she did not need to do that.
Why is May on a diet?
Oh... homecoming.
Her first. Dress search was epic.
Okay. Tell me what you think.
(<em>Gasps</em>)
Daddy didn't like the first one.
Said it was too low-cut.
<strong>Harry</strong>: Yeah, it was.
I could almost see your belly button.
No, you could not.
It's perfect, May.
(<em>Giggles</em>)
Just like you. (<em>Laughs</em>)
Right, Bobby?
Yeah. You look beautiful.
<strong>May</strong>: Then I guess we have a winner.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Hey, guys, I'm sorry to cut this short, but I have, uh, an early shift, so I better get home and get a good night's sleep.
But I want to see all the pictures from your big night.
Good night, Bobby.
Good night.
Um...
I-I'll walk you out.
Oh, Bobby, Bobby, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm sorry. I just...
I didn't think about how hard that would be for you.
No, don't-don't do that. Please.
Please, don't feel bad about this.
You have two wonderful children with a lifetime of milestones ahead of them, and I want you to be able to enjoy each and every one of them without worrying about me.
Well, don't tell me I can't do both.
I mean, multitasking is one of my many talents.
(<em>Both laugh</em>)
Come here.
Are you sure you don't want to come back inside?
Yeah, I should get some rest.
Tomorrow morning will be here before we know it.
All right, good night.
Night.

Look at those tapered waists, wide shoulders and explosive quads.
Too much for a man? You decide.
Double bicep.
Yeah!

<strong>Bobby</strong>: LAFD. Clear a path.
What the hell?
Keep filming.
Looks like extreme hyponatremia.
<strong>Bret</strong>: Say what?
He's got a charley horse.
He is a charley horse.
What's your name?
Charlie.
Okay, Charlie, when was the last time you had any fluids?
Yesterday afternoon.
Flushed yourself out for the competition today?
And for the weigh-ins, to make the veins pop.
Well, you are definitely popping.
All right, Charlie, your potassium and your sodium have bottomed out and that's why you're seizing up.
Now, before we start replenishing your electrolytes, you got to answer me <strong>Honestly</strong>: are you dosing?
N-No steroids, if that's what you mean. I'm totally clean.
Okay, you two need to back off.
Get that camera out of here, please.
Cap needs room to work.
I'm working, too.
You can work further back.
Charlie, I just need you to know that if you're not being straight with me, and we start giving you saline and you have been dosing, your kidneys could start to fail, okay?
And that'd be on you.
I'm on steroids.
Okay, that's better. Are you taking anything else?
I took a diuretic last night to shed some water weight.
That explains his low blood pressure. 70/40.
All right, let's get him transported.
On three, everybody. Ready? One, two, three.
(<em>Shouting</em>)
Am I, am I gonna be okay?
We're gonna get you through the day.
You'd think he'd earn a trophy for holding that pose so long.
Right?
Captain, we'd love to get some words from you.
Okay, here's a few: stop pointing that camera at people who are in distress.
The people we serve have to feel like they can trust us and can be honest with us; otherwise, mistakes get made.
We're totally using that.
(<em>Buck laughs</em>)
(<em>Mouths</em>)
All right... (<em>Chuckles</em>)
Is he always so prickly?
Who, Cap? Uh, nah. He, uh... he barks a little, but ring that bell, he's, he's one of the guys.
I don't think he likes me much.
It's funny, 'cause you're so likable.
(<em>Laughs</em>) Well, I am trying.
Look, Cap is not prickly, okay?
He just, he just doesn't know you yet, that's all.
We-we get two, three calls, right?
He's putting out fires all day.
The rest of us, we just have to be one thing at a time.
The guy in his job, he has to be everything.
The truth is, he inspires me every single day.
And I am trying to put a giant spotlight on him.
On all of you unsung heroes.
Tell your story.
To him, we're not the story.
We're just here to make sure no story ends before it should.
911. What is your emergency?
This is 911. Is anyone there?
<strong>Woman (<em>over phone</em>)</strong>: I-I'm sorry. I...
Ma'am, are you having an emergency?
Do you need me to send some help?
(<em>Panting</em>)
Tell me where you are.
If you're afraid of someone hearing, if you're not alone, pretend you're talking to someone else.
A friend, a-a telemarketer.
Act like you're ordering a pizza... just give me your location, and I will send help.
<strong>Woman</strong>: I'm sorry. Wrong number.
(<em>Dial tone</em>)
(<em>Panting</em>)
(<em>Gasps</em>)
Sue, hi. Good morning.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm-I'm just tired. I haven't... been sleeping very well.
You've been a great addition to the team, Maddie.
I'm impressed with how you've taken to the job.
Sometimes, I forget you haven't been doing it for very long.
I'm sorry. Did I do something wrong?
Not at all. No.
But I am concerned.
You're tired, skittish. (<em>Laughs</em>)
I know the job can be stressful, and I just want to make sure that you know we have resources available if you're having trouble managing the stress.
There's no shame in asking for help.
It's not the job.
I mean, right this very second it is the job, but it's... really that the job is reminding me of my life.
My marriage.
Call hit a little close to home?
She wouldn't... couldn't speak, and I could hear her crying, and...
I knew what was wrong, but she wouldn't let me help her.
Maybe I should've told her that it was all gonna be okay.
You know, that she could just leave and not live her life in fear.
But it's not true.
I-I ran 2,600 miles away, and it doesn't even feel far enough.
(<em>Sniffles</em>)
I mean, my apartment is a fortress.
I sleep with a baseball bat by my bed, and I still don't feel safe.
It's like I never got up off that floor.
But you did.
You got up and you got out.
A-And I'm sure that there had been moments when the idea of that felt impossible.
Yet, here you are.
Just trust yourself and keep moving forward.
It's gotten you here so far.
It'll get you the rest of the way.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
New arrival.
When they send it in plastic, you know it's gonna be good.
Aw.
Serious, you guys? You couldn't even leave me any crumbs?
Ooh, Chim, you missed out.
Is that chocolate?
Mmm. Fudge, with nuts.
I love fudge with nuts.
Oh, damn, you would've loved these because... scrumptious.
I'm sorry you had to see this, this dark underbelly of hour 21 in a 24-hour shift.
Gets pretty mercenary around here.

<strong>Man (<em>over P.A.</em>)</strong>: Attention, Station 118.
Medical aid. Unknown injury.
PD's responding.
Where's Captain Nash?
He's sitting this one out, wrapping the shift.
It's a simple med call.
(<em>Siren wailing</em>)
(<em>Horn honking</em>)
He doesn't want to talk to you.
He'll talk to me.
I am done going up in that chopper and reporting on gridlock.
Come on.
Captain Nash, I know you don't think very highly of me.
I also know that you've been avoiding me.
But I want you to know I only have one goal here: to tell a story, a true story, about your station.
You can have a true story.
There's truth around us all the time.
There's truth right here on this napkin.
I'm sorry?
Every crumb is a universe onto itself.
The more you zoom in, the more you'll see.
Is he high?
(<em>Laughter</em>)
I think they're all high.
These are specs of chocolate and entire worlds at the same time.
Holy crap. I think it's the brownies.
They've been dosed.
Wait, you didn't have one, did you?
(<em>Chuckles</em>)
Do I look like I eat fudge?
Keep rolling.
(<em>Siren wailing, horn honking</em>)
Man. Allergies are going crazy today.
You, too, huh? The index wasn't elevated this morning.
Think it's a new kind?
New kind of what?
Of pollen.
A new kind of pollen?
You're not feeling this, Chim?
No, I do not.
I can see the pollen.
I can hear it.
This is ridiculous. She's the one who cheated.
She and her demon seed.
That little girl is 11 if she's a day.
I want to see the birth certificate.
Ma'am, calm down, or I'll charge you with resisting arrest, too.
For what? This was self-defense. My ex-husband's a lawyer.
Oh, good. 'Cause I'm-a need you to contact him to come and pick up your daughter.
Victim's over there.
<strong>Natalie (<em>muffled</em>)</strong>: Tell him it's an emergency.
Who goes to Aruba this time of year?
Excuse me, ma'am?
I'm trying to reach my plastic surgeon.
Okay, uh, uh, first things first.
Um, your adrenaline's probably spiked, which is why you haven't passed out yet, so I'm gonna ask you, please, just please sit right here, hold that if you can, and maybe hang up the phone, okay?
Thank you. Thank you very much.
All right, guys. Hey!
Diaz, Buckley, let's go!
(<em>Children giggling</em>)
Did these beauty queens shrink, or are we suddenly giants?
Please don't arrest me. I-I'll pay for any medical bills if we could just let this slide.
I'm so sorry. I stopped birth control because I started menopause, and now my hormones are going crazy.
Can I get my shoe back?
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Can someone please bring me the rest of my gear?
I think he means you, guys.
<strong>Buck</strong>: Hey, Athena.
They're, like, the tiniest ladies I've ever seen.
(<em>High-pitched</em>): Teeny-tiny. Just...
Excuse me?
(<em>Whispers</em>): So tiny.
Henrietta!
'Thena.
Oh, 'Thena, you smell like love.
Chimney?
Need you over here.
727-L-30, requesting immediate R.A. backup at Beverly Wilton Hotel, Pacific Ballroom.
Where the hell is my lido...
We got a problem here.
Your guys be tripping.
What? Guys, look at me.
Do you know where you are?
We're everywhere, man.
They're on drugs.
(<em>Laughing</em>)
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Okay, okay.
Oh. Oh, my God, it's the brownies.
Brownies?
We got a new batch today.
We've been getting a lot of stuff lately, especially since the earthquake.
You guys eat that stuff?
We just throw that stuff right in the trash.
We're firefighters. Everybody loves us.
Oh...
Now watch this.
You see?
Mm-hmm.
Do you know why the liquid rises like that?
Physics?
I'm gonna do it again.
I think...
No, this is show-and-tell.
It's not show-and-touch, Brook.
I don't want you to burn yourself.
I'm Taylor. Who's Brook?
There are so many lights in here.
And colors.
Lights and colors and death.
You died.
Someone died?
Did you lose someone, Captain Nash?
Brook?
She's not lost. She's right here.
She's taller than her mother now.
In a few seconds, she's gonna be taller than both of us.
<strong>Taylor</strong>: Hmm.
(<em>Echoes</em>): She's still with you.
(<em>Echoes</em>): She's always with me.
Nobody's picking up at the fire station.
You should call dispatch, get them to take everything off-line.
Did that.
Why aren't you taking it out?
They'll take it out at the hospital.
So let's go to the hospital.
We'll get you there. I called 911.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: What's going on?
I don't like this.
Ooh, you made him cry.
<strong>Athena</strong>: All right, just breathe, okay? You're gonna be okay.
All right? Somebody dosed you with an hallucinogen.
We don't want you to hurt yourself or anyone else.
Yeah. I like that idea.
'Thena, your head is beating like your heart.
Is it?
Still no answer.
Do you know if Bobby ate any of those brownies?
(<em>Siren wailing</em>)
What happened?
He was high, and then he got higher.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Look at me again and tell me another joke.
We were talking and he mentioned something about Brook and then he shot up like the room was on fire and he said he had to go.
And you're okay filming this?
Who do you think called the cops?
Bobby.
Bobby, it's me.
Just take one step back, turn around, and we can talk.
Hey.
Hey.
They get it wrong, about saving lives.
The ones that we save are the ones we lose.
That's why we save them up here, like photographs.
But this, I've never... this is new.
She's so bright and alive. Can you see her?
No.
It's not real. You know that.
No, my daughter Brook, she's... she's floating in the sky, behind your head.
I know it sounds crazy.
I-I just want to float away with her wherever she goes, with so much color.
It's not real.
But maybe, just maybe, it can be enough.
Enough for you to say good-bye.
Enough for you to hear her say it's okay.
Enough so that in the morning, when your head is right and your eyes are clear, you can remember that you caught a glimpse of what's around us every day.
She's right there.
Right here, right now.
You're real, I'm real.
We can be real together.
Hey, how's the chief?
Ah, he's in pretty good humor, considering.
(<em>Chuckles</em>)
Tox report came back.
It was the brownies. LSD.
Mm. Do they know who?
It's still under investigation, but they figure it was some sort of prank.
Oh, yeah. Because poisoning firefighters is just funny. Ha.
I don't get the punch line.
Well, how about this one?
Taylor Kelly's exclusive report on 118 comes out tomorrow night.
Firefighters drugged against their will, captain loses sobriety, news at 11:00.
Do not waste a moment's worry on that woman.
It doesn't matter what kind of take she's trying to spin.
The camera doesn't lie.
Anyone who's watching is gonna see what I see: a good man who's been through some tough times, but who's come through the other side... someone who, despite everything he's lost, still goes out there and risks everything he has left to help others.
They're gonna see a hero.
Hmm.
Athena, I'm an addict and an alcoholic who has barely three days under his belt.
I don't feel like a hero, I feel like a failure.
But you didn't fall off the wagon, you were pushed.
I know, but...
I don't feel like a failure 'cause I got high, I feel like a failure because I want to get high again.
Felt good.
No, it made me feel free. I... I...
I didn't feel as much of the pain, it felt like it was, far away, like it belonged to somebody else.
I felt like if I could just keep floating I wouldn't have to feel it anymore.
Well, when I saw you after that, it looked like you were feeling all of it.
Yeah. The reality always catches up.
If it didn't, none of us would ever get sober again.
But you are, right?
Yes.
But...
Painful, I...
I go to my meetings, I go to church, I try to stay on track, but...
When I'm sober, I feel this crushing weight on top of me, and there are times like now when I feel like, I don't know how much longer I can keep carrying it.
Or maybe you should stop trying to carry it alone.
...And everything kinda sparkled.
Ah, I'd say it was more glistening, like the whole world was covered in doo.
You think this is why people go to Burning Man?
I see them every day on the streets of Los Angeles running into burning buildings, pulling people from wrecked cars and collapsing high-rises, and even saving this reporter from a helicopter that spun out of control.
Where's Kev?
No watching with us?
No, said he had other things to do.
I think *** rather do anything other than this.
They are the brave men and women of the Los Angeles Fire Department.
And it was my own brush with death that inspired me to share their story, so you can all see what it takes and what it means to be one of them.
Missed a hell of a show.

All right, how bad was it?
No, not bad at all.
You were barely in it.
Um, it was nice, you know, kind-kind of like a puff piece.
She didn't use any of your interview or mention the LSD.
Why would she leave that stuff out?
I, uh...
I think she likes me.
Mm.
I mean, what little kid doesn't want to be a firefighter?
Especially, a hot firefighter.
You know, their skill kept me from dying, but the way they cared for me, that's what kept me alive.
The people we serve have to feel like they can trust us and be honest with us, otherwise mistakes can be made.
They were great!
And not just the medical stuff either, I mean, they just... they seemed like real decent people.
I worry about them, under so much stress all the time.
I wish I could do something to ease their burden.
A dose of something to lift their spirits, clear their minds.

Sandy, you in here?
(<em>Gasps</em>)
Is that...?
Uh, uh...
I don't know.
Some kind of hybrid part wild, part domestic cat?
Well, let's hope he's in touch with his domestic side.
Hey, buddy, you're okay.
Sandy?
Sandy?
You sure about this?
Uh, yeah, pretty sure.
This doesn't look safe.
I've freed my mind!
Then I freed them! Oh.
Sandy, how much acid did you take?
Not much. I microdose.
No, ma'am, I don't think you do.
In fact, I think you macrodosed my entire firestation.
'Cause I put too much?
I... I just wanted to give you all a little clarity.
In my line of work, that's called a felony.
(<em>Laughs</em>)
All across Los Angeles, residents are under attack from a new and troubling threat: Aedes aegypti, stealth like mosquitoes that have invaded the Southland and are out for blood.
Wow, thank you for that story.
That is some frightening stuff right there.
Exactly, we were just talking about this in the studio before we went to air, about this very problem...
Uh, just a minute, I'll be right there.
Hi. Come on in.
So, I was just out and I saw this and I thought of you.
What?
No!
It's just a housewarming gift.
Oh, not a book.
DVD, Mission Impossible.
Uh, you do have a DVD player, right?
Yeah. And a popcorn maker.
Would you like to hang out and watch a movie?
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to.
Doesn't look like you'll have to worry about traffic anymore.
Hey there. I guess so.
Our department piece was pretty well received, so they're letting me do more.
Nothing major yet just mosquitoes and neighbors fighting about bamboo, but it's a start.
Well I will miss hearing your voice everyday.
I'm happy for you and... and I wanted to thank you for what you did for Bobby, not using any of that stuff he said.
Oh, that wasn't my call.
I wanted to use all of it, I got overruled.
Uh, wait... you were gonna use it?
Oh yeah. The only reason we didn't is because apparently your lawyers are scarier than ours.
Look your job is saving lives.
Mine is telling their stories even the ones they might not want me to.
That's some stupid job.
It's all you really care about.
Hey, I wanted to be a reporter since I was 14.
I put myself through college, spent years interning for next to no pay, I did traffic in the hopes that it would lead to my big break, which it did.
This stupid job isn't stupid to me.
You don't have to like it but you don't get to make me feel bad about it.
Well, I don't like it.
And I don't care.
Just get a room already.
(<em>Doorbell rings</em>)
Is it...?
Yeah, okay.
Oh yeah.
Hey, I got the batteries.
Hey, you are a lifesaver.
No problem, no problem. Wow.
Thank you so much, my man.
Wow.

I told him to just use a cellphone camera, but he's old-school.
No, he's a proud father, he wants those real photos.
All right. You want something to eat?
We have plenty.
I'm good.
Hey, hey, Harry!
Come over here and take one with your sister.
Right here, right here.
Run, Bobby. Save yourself.
Just right here.
This doesn't, uh, resemble my high-school homecoming at all.
It's much more elaborate than I expected.
I know. Mine either.
I am already dreading prom.
You know about prom proposals, right?
I do not.
What?
Google it. Another reason to be glad we're not teenagers anymore.
<strong>Harry</strong>: Your turn, Mom.
Come on, let's get this over with.
All right, you're on. All right.
(<em>Laughs</em>)
Yeah. Let's do this.
Let's do it. All right.
Oh, yeah, that's it. That's it.
Ooh.
Here, here.
Why don't you get in there? I'll-I'll take a few.
Oh, with me?
Yeah.
Oh, man. You know what? That's nice. That's nice.
You bet. All right.
Thank you.
It's the real deal right here. This is a serious camera.
All right. One happy-looking family.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Ah.
(<em>Bobby laughs</em>)
Oh, honey. What happened to your bracelet?
It must've fell off. I have to find it.
Grandma gave that to me.
Oh.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Wait, I think this is it right over here.
Yep. All right.
<strong>May</strong>: Awesome.
All right.
Okay, May. Let's see if I can do this.
There we go. Perfect.
Thanks so much, Bobby.
(<em>Laughs</em>)
All right, we're back in business.
Okay.
All right. Look up here.
<strong>Michael</strong>: Hey, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Nico, would you mind taking a picture of all of us, please?
Bobby, get in here.
I shouldn't.
It should just be the family.
Come on. Just one. Come on.
