Remember to use the cream I'm giving you.
And for God's sake, put on some underwear.
Good morning, Doc.
It's 4:00 p. m.
Well, it's morning to me.
Hello, sir.
I need you to be on high alert today, Vaughn.
Inmates have been acting extra combative lately.
Any idea why?
Could be the new warden's reforms, but I don't know.
Feels like somebody's been agitating.
Copy that. Where do you want me?
The usual. Mitchell needs a walk.
 Not again.
 You're the only one he likes.
Hands.
All right, let's go. You know the drill.
GUARD Let's go! Line it up!
This guy is so freaking weird.
Hey. No littering.
All right, time's up.
Let's pack it in.
This is 911 Metro. Is this a drill?
<i>This is Security Chief Isaacs at Jamestown State Prison.</i> The code is 57-Charlie-Adam-James.
Color of the day is yellow.
code yellow.
Inmates have broken free of containment and have taken control of Cell Blocks A and C.
We have multiple fires burning, <i>and the ventilation system</i> <i>is pushing smoke throughout the prison.</i> Situation is critical. I repeat, this is not a drill.
<i>The unrest started in Cell Block Two</i> <i>and spread quickly.</i> <i>Then a handful of prisoners</i> <i>took out the fire suppression system</i> <i>and started setting fires around the facility.</i> We managed to put out the smaller fires, but the biggest one's still burning in the HVAC corridor.
What are we walking through to get to the fire?
Eyes, buzz us through.
<i>The riot's only 40% contained at the moment,</i> <i>o you'll be escorted by four ofs my men in full protective gear</i> <i>carrying nonlethal weaponry.</i> <i>The main corridor is clear and locked down tight.</i> <i>e'll get you in and out safely.
 W</i> <i>You just have to take care of that fire.</i> All right, guys, get those hoses set.
Come on, let's go. Let's go!
Buck, Eddie, put up a water curtain.
That thing is gonna keep sucking smoke up into the system.
Okay, Ravi, go find the kill switch.
You let me know when you got it.
We got it, Cap.
All right, guys, knock it down, knock it down.
 All right, guys, let's go.
 You got it.
 Okay, Garcia, fire's out. Sorry.
Block Three's blowing up. I got to go deal with that.
 What about our escort?
 Block Two is still locked down.
Wilkinson can handle your walk out.
Come on, let's go.
Okay, 118, let's go.
We're on the move.
What is that? Is someone else in here?
No, this area should be secure.
Over here.
Holy crap, that's Mitchell.
I wonder who got the drop on him.
Maybe one of your colleagues.
It doesn't look like he held back, either.
 Airway's compromised.
We're probably looking at a crushed trachea.
 All right, we got to move.
 Whoa, whoa, hey.
 These men are injured.
 Oh, and the guy in the shackles has got a nasty gash in his lower abdomen.
They're scumbags. Leave 'em here.
<i>GUARD  e've lost control of Block One.
 W</i> <i>All guards, fall back.</i> We're not leaving anybody. All right.
Let's get 'em up and out. No time for gurneys.
Yes, Warden, I get it, but there's no way I can confidently say anything's been put down at this point.
<i>We just lost the mess hall.</i> <i>Inmates are loose in the main corridor.</i> Sir, we're struggling to maintain control.
Eyes, buzz us out.
Whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop! He's having a seizure.
Okay, get him down, get him down.
All right, you guys go. Your guy can barely breathe.
Go. We're gonna be right behind you. That's an order.
 Now, go.
 Protocol says you got to have two guards with you.
Plenty of room if you want to join.
I need an ambulance escort for a prisoner transporting to the local ER.
 Anybody copy? <i>Vaughn here.</i> <i>Me and Mahoney are on the way.</i> I got to get back in there.
Don't try to leave without that escort, all right?
Okay, how we doing, Hen? We got to move.
Seizure's probably due to blood loss.
 Cap, let's get him outside.
 Okay. All right.
Grab him by the arms.
Because reinforcements still need to move between sections.
Damn it.
Loose inmates in Block Two.
Need backup for Block Two!
You guys our escort?
Yes, sir. Let's get moving.
LAFD, you need to move.
Infirmary, it's still secure.
Okay, let's move! Let's go.
Move! Come on.
<i>Vaughn and Mahoney are escorting a prisoner.</i> Let 'em through.
We can't get out. We've got an injured inmate.
Here, put him over on the bed.
 Help me over here!
Sorry, Doc. You okay?
Yeah, yeah. I'll be fine.
What's going on with the patient?
He's got a stab wound to the lower abdomen.
He's lost a lot of blood.
He was convulsing, but it's slowed.
It's probably from the BP. He'll need fluids.
Wait. That's not an inmate.
That's Freddie Vaughn.
He's a guard.
 What?
 Where'd you find him?
In the machine room, next to the other prisoner.
 But if this one's a guard...
 The other one probably is, too.
So where are the prisoners?
<i>118 ambulance, come in.</i> <i>Buck, Eddie, come in.</i>  Mm-mm. <i>-Buck, Eddie,</i> <i>if you can hear me, return to the prison.</i> <i>Come...</i> Kill the lights and sirens.
What the hell?
I can't thank you boys enough.
I've waited 18 years to get the hell out of that place.
Check 'em.
Okay, so you broke out.
What now?
Patient in there currently fighting for every breath.
That your handiwork?
Hey. No littering.
<i>GUARD Rapid Team, fire and rescue's six minutes out.</i> <i>You got to clear a path.</i> <i>Push those guys back.</i>  So, what do we do?
 Don't know yet.
 Maybe they just want the ambulance?
 Why would they search us if they're gonna leave us behind?
There's two of us.
There's two of them.
 There's two...
 Cute kid.
Yours?
I'm guessing he lives with you at 4995 South Bedford Street.
Hey, man. Hey, don't even...
Okay, so now that we're all on the same page, here's what's gonna happen next.
Warden isn't sure if the riot was cover for the escape or if the escapees just seized on the opportunity.
So Buck and Eddie are in an ambulance with two convicts and an injured guard.
Well, dispatch has tracked the transponder on the ambulance.
It's been stationary for a couple minutes.
I've got units heading there right now.
What about Bobby and the rest of the 118?
They're still inside the prison.
Looks like the blade must've hit his splenic artery.
We can clamp it, slow his blood loss.
We should give him something for the pain first.
Top drawer. One vial of morphine.
 Stop. Don't sedate him.
 I need you to wake him up.
 What?
Look, you said he's in security, right?
I need somebody who can tell me about security protocols here.
Who has keys, what they open and if we're safe in here.
I've been a doctor here for a decade.
I can tell you there are mine, the warden's and the shift commander's.
We're perfectly safe.
The shift commander in the Lexan booth who let us in here?
Yes, the security pod. Why?
 Listen.
You hear that?
What is that?
If I had to guess, I'd say that's a bunch of guys trying to break into the security pod.
I need reinforcements to the security pod!
 There's no way they...
 Doc, I have been a firefighter for nearly three decades, and trust me when I say there is not a locked room anywhere that the right tools and enough time can't break open.
Now, please, wake him up.
Should be about half a mile ahead-- on the right.
Dispatch, I'm not seeing anything resembling an ambulance on this road.
It has to be there.
You just passed it.
What?
I don't know what you're seeing on your end.
Their transponder is pinging to your location.
You should be on top of them right now.
Yeah, about that.
Is he all right?
Other than choking on his own blood?
Buck, hand me the Yankauer suction tube.
Hey, just make sure he doesn't die in here.
Suddenly, you care about the guy you almost beat to death?
Hey, if I wanted this guy dead, he'd be dead.
I kept him alive.
Now, you do the same.
Warden sent me their inmate files.
We can't track 'em, but maybe we can figure out where they might've gone.
Dominic Gale.
He's not from here.
He got picked up six years ago on an out-of-state warrant for a home invasion in Milwaukee.
Six years ago? What's he still doing in a California prison?
Uh, he killed a fellow prisoner while awaiting extradition, so we decided to hang on to him until after he finishes his 20.
No local ties. What about the other one?
Mitchell Trent-- he's been on death row for 18 years.
Uh, triple homicide.
Hmm. And a long-ass list of prior offenses.
Yeah, dating back to a sealed juvenile record.
No visitors, no pen pals.
Until last year.
According to this, he started writing letters to his ex.
 An ex from 18 years ago?
 Mm-hmm.
Savanna Richards. She testified at his trial.
She was the state's key witness against him.
 She still local?
 She is.
We need to get her into protection right now.
Do you really think that he'd go through all this trouble breaking out just to settle an old score?
18 years is a long time to stew.
Maybe that pot finally boiled over.
You, go around back.
If they are inside, I don't want them making another escape.
 You, with me.
 Yes, ma'am.
LAPD. Anybody home?
Police department.
 You looking for Savanna?
 Yeah. We knocked.
She doesn't seem to be home.
She's barely here.
Usually doesn't get home till late.
Do you know how I might find her? It's important.
Uh, I have her contact.
Let me grab my phone.
Okay.
Let's get an unmarked unit here.
All right? They can sit on the house until our jailbirds are back in their cage.
Also, I want a patrol doing laps around this neighborhood  looking for that ambulance.
 Yes, Sergeant.
Here you go.
 Much appreciated, ma'am. Thank you.
 Mm-hmm.
Savanna Richards?
This is Sergeant Athena Grant with the LAPD.
Can you tell me where you are right now?
Okay, okay. Vaughn.
Vaughn, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Vaughn? Okay, good. Okay.
I'm sorry about this, and I don't know how much you remember, but I am with the Los Angeles Fire Department.
There was a riot here. We tried to put out a fire, and we got stuck in here on our way out. Do you understand me?
Yeah? Okay, good. Listen.
The guards lost control of this cell block, and I don't know how much time we have in here until the rioters start coming for us.
And I need to get you and my people out of this infirmary.
Cap, he needs pain management.
You need to stop this.
Vaughn, is there any way out of here  besides through that door?
Can we go through any air ducts or tunnels or crawl spaces?
P-P-P...
The pod?
The security pod is under siege.
G-Gas.
Gas.
 Tear gas? I suppose we could try to contact the guards, if there are any real guards left, and have them run up to the HVAC, but we turned it off 'cause of the smoke.
Are we even sure tear gas would work?
Kind of feels like it would just make everyone mad.
Nitrous oxide.
Laughing gas?
That'll make them less mad.
All right, Doc, draw me a map, and I will turn the HVAC on, and I'll go into the dental office, and I'll run what's ever in there through the vents, and we hope that works.
That sounds like a lot of distance to cover, Cap.
I should go with you.
I-I can turn on the HVAC, and you can  get the gas.
 No, you're needed here.
Doc only has one hand, and Vaughn could go south again.
I'll go.
I can do it.
You'll be a target.
Heroic firefighters might make especially good ones.
What if he doesn't look like a firefighter?
Doesn't look like anything is broken, but you probably won't have normal range of motion for at least a few weeks.
But tell me, Firefighter Wilson, will I play piano again?
Did you before?
I didn't think the joke was that bad.
 Sorry.
You made me think of a friend of mine.
It's the kind of joke he'd make.
He's a paramedic, too.
Well, if he's anywhere near as sharp as you, I have sorely underestimated the skills of the Los Angeles Fire Department.
Maybe I should've gone into your line of work.
Well, thank you.
I was actually, uh, looking at heading into your line of work.
Oh. Medical school?
What year?
 Second.
Tough year.
He's bottoming out. He's about to code.
The blood buildup from the clamp must have burst the artery.
 What's the next step?
 Well, if we were in an operating room-- which we're not-- a surgeon would need to do an end-to-end anastomosis.
Suture the artery to return normal blood flow to his spleen.
Well, can you...
Not like this. It's too involved.
You know the procedure.
Yeah, I-I've observed two.
 But I can't...
 Yes, you can.
I-I'm not a doctor. Not yet.
He doesn't need you to be a doctor.
He needs you to be my hands.
He needs you to help me save his life.
 What are you doing now?
 Intubating him.
Buck, hand me the bougie. Long blue tube in the cabinet.
Almost there, Mitch.
Wait, you guys are serious?
 We're really going to a hospital?
 Thought that's what you wanted.
You're so concerned about the health of your friend here.
Now you can walk him through the front doors.
Doesn't look like we have any company.
All right, pretty boy stays with me.
Dom, you and the kid take our friend inside.
Hand him off, then you know what to do.
Hey, man, listen, I don't know what you want, but there is a hospital full of sick people...
Just go, or I'll shoot you.
Or better yet, I shoot him.
And then I find his kid and I shoot him, too.
Buck.
Nice and steady.
Just like you've done it a thousand times before.
Okay.
Where do we go?
Right this way.
Where the hell is everyone?
Hey, hey! Aah! Hey, hey, hey!
Come on, hey, I-I'm a firefighter!
 Hands behind your back.
 Evan Buckley with the 118.
 Aah! Hey. Hey.
 Hey, come on!
 Ah-ah-ah!
 Buck? Buck.
Uh, hey. This one's good.
 Let him up. Let him go.
 You sure? Okay.
 On your feet.
 Sorry about that.
All right, let's go. You have the right to remain silent.
 I suggest you use that right.
 Call it in?
 You good?
Yeah. How'd you know we were coming here?
We figured out why Mitchell broke out.
Where is he? Where's Mitchell?
Still in the ambulance.
With Eddie.
Mitchell Trent, this is LAPD.
We have the area surrounded. Put your weapons down  and come out with your hands up.
 I got a hostage!
Don't come any closer!
How did they find us so fast?
Guess this wasn't part of your 27-step breakout plan.
Shut up.
 I need a minute to think.
 Might want to think on the fact that there's only one way out of this ambulance.
Look, just give up.
You can live to escape another day.
I ain't going nowhere.
Unless it's inside that hospital.
Tac team is working on a plan to take the ambulance.
Look, as soon as they make their move, he is gonna shoot Eddie.
There's got to be a way to talk him down, get him to surrender.
It's a little more complicated than that, Buck.
Surrender is not what Mitchell's after.
He came to see his son.
My son...
he's here, in the ICU.
Congenital heart failure.
Kid's been waiting almost a year for a new heart.
So you're here to force his way up the list at gunpoint.
No.
I'm here to give him mine.
I'm thirsty.
Don't drink it all, man.
This is a toast.
I told you they killed Mitchell.
Man, leave some.
Hey!
You!
Do I know you?
Let me see you.
Hey, hey!
Hey, get back here. I'm talking to you.
I hope that's enough.
Okay.
Forceps are set on either side of the ruptured area.
The patient has been sedated.
And the atraumatic needle is prepped.
Remember, simple continuous sutures, just like they taught you in home ec class.
I took shop.
Good, good.
Perfect.
Done.
Excellent, Dr. Wilson.
I told you I'm not a doctor.
Yet.
That'll be our little secret.
<i>BOBBY Hen, it's a go.</i> Copy that, Cap.
What's going on? Was there another fire?
Think you're gonna need this.
 You guys okay? You tell me.
Did it work?
Okay, guys, let's go. We got to move.
 I guess it did. Let's go.
<i>WOMAN On-call chaplain to ICU One.</i> <i>On-call chaplain to ICU One.</i> This is Savanna Richards.
Mitchell's ex, Nolan's mom.
So Nolan is why he broke out?
Mitchell started writing me letters last year, saying that he wanted to save his son.
I still don't know how he found out about Nolan.
Wait, you mean you didn't tell him?
The last time that I saw Mitchell was in a courtroom 18 years ago.
He tried to jump the defense table to get me, screaming he was gonna kill me for betraying him.
I told him to rot in hell.
I didn't think there was much to say after that.
Mitchell's been waging a campaign to save Nolan.
He's contacted the State Board of Prisoners, the governor, asking to be executed.
I thought we didn't do that anymore.
Legally, it's complicated.
But he wants the state to kill him so he can donate his heart.
All of his requests were denied.
So he decided to force the issue.
Mitchell still hasn't responded.
Does he need to respond?
We know what his demands are, right?
He wants to donate his heart to his kid.
Buck, that's not on the table.
It's not even on the menu.
State of California doesn't allow death row inmates to donate their organs.
Come on, that's just a technicality.
It's a law, Buck.
Prisoners have made petitions to donate their kidneys, pieces of their liver to family, and every request to become an organ donor has been denied.
Well, there-there's got to be something else we can do.
Look, we're still trying to talk to him, give him a chance to surrender peacefully.
And if he doesn't?
Then we take the ambulance.
Stop moving around.
Police see the ambulance moving, they're gonna think something's wrong, and they'll breach.
So? I'm the one they're gonna shoot.
Space this small, not a lot of room for error.
Rather not get caught in crossfire.
Hey, why can't you understand?
I'm trying to do one good thing here.
You got bored in a cage, and you wanted a way out.
No, I'm doing this for Nolan.
I'm trying to save his life.
He tell you this is what he wants?
To get your heart and live the rest of his life knowing how much blood you shed so he could have it?
You think that's a feel-good ending for him?
What do you want me to do? Go back to prison?
Sit there rotting in my cell while my kid dies?
I want you to shut up.
And let me help you.
Bobby.
 Everyone okay? <i>Everybody here is fine.-</i> Just dropped off the injured guard at the hospital.
<i>How are Buck and Eddie doing?</i> Buck's fine. I'm standing right here with him.
What about Eddie?
So, what was the plan after you got into the hospital?
Dom was supposed to go in there, confirm that Nolan was there.
Then he was gonna force the doctors to do the transplant.
I die, Nolan lives.
Do you really think anyone was gonna let that happen?
No, probably not, but it was the only thing I could come up with.
Turn yourself in.
Let them take you into custody alive, and we find another way to save your son.
Like what?
Buck, the other guy, his girlfriend's a reporter.
We have her do a story on your son, get the public behind Nolan, pressure the governor into letting you donate.
I don't want that for him.
People knowing I'm his father.
When they sentenced me to death, the judge said I was "the worst of the worst." And he was right.
I was like my dad, who was like his dad.
All of us in and out of prison our whole lives like it was the family business, uh...
When I... when I found out about Nolan, I was like, "Great.
I'll meet him when he shows up in the cell next to me." He's not like that, though.
He's a good kid.
Nothing like me at all.
So you think saving him, what, redeems you?
No.
But...
... me dying and him living maybe makes the world a better place.
Okay.
Go on, open up the door. Let 'em know we're coming out.
You mean it?
Did you mean it?
What you said about helping Nolan?
I'll fight for him as hard as I'd fight for my own.
Good.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Okay, we're coming out.
Mitchell's ready to surrender.
Hands up!
Okay, Mitchell.
Put down your gun.
Come on out.
They're coming out.
He's out. He's out.
 Show us your hands!
 Hands up.
Hold. Everybody hold.
Hold your positions.
One more promise from you.
What now?
When he asks about the donor, he can never know it was me.
Drop the gun!
Eddie.
 Move!
 Let's go!
Move in! Move in!
Eddie! Eddie!
Eddie.
Get out! Get out!
Go grab a crash cart and help me keep his heart pumping.
What are you doing? What happened?
He shot himself. Bullet hit his brain.
Go tell the hospital they need a crash team out here.
They need to prep an OR.
Eddie, he's dead.
But his heart isn't, and I need it to stay that way.
Go!
Okay! Prep the OR! Come on!
I know you got other things on your mind right now, but...
I'm-I'm so sorry that he put you through that.
But that's Mitchell.
Couldn't do the right thing to save his life.
I don't know what I'm gonna tell Nolan.
About his father?
About me.
How do I explain ever being with a man like Mitchell?
You loved him, even if he wasn't worth loving.
But that's on Mitchell.
Whatever bad choices he made, they're his.
You don't end up with a man like Mitchell without having made a few bad choices of your own.
You helped put him away.
That was brave.
I did it for Nolan.
I never wanted him to be touched by any of this.
Neither did Mitchell.
He was watching you for years, from a distance.
He saw that Nolan was a good kid.
Mitchell didn't want to screw him up, too.
He said that?
Right before he...
The last thing he said...
"He can never know it was me." <i>That boy is going to die without that heart.</i> And the father-- or whatever you want to call him-- has made himself a donor.
Let's just let 'em do the surgery, figure the rest out later.
This is way above our pay grade.
We don't make the laws, just enforce them.
Well, what exactly does the law say?
"Death row inmates," right?
I know what you're thinking, but there is no way, Athena.
The governor is never going to pardon him for a triple homicide, not even posthumously.
What would he say to a commutation?

Good news across the board.
But I don't think I can wait around for any more.

 Yeah.
 You headed home?
No. I have class in an hour.
After the day and night you had, you're still going to class?
Yeah. Well...

Didn't know you'd decided on a specialty.

How about that?
Oh.
It's done.
He made it through okay?
Yeah. They're, um... they're wheeling him into recovery now.
Um...
I-I really can't thank you all enough.
Not just for what you did but, um, for being here... with me.
Go be with your son.
Thank you.
I'm gonna go see mine.
I'm headed out, too.
I'll, uh, see you in 48 hours.

It's funny, after a shift like the one we just had, with all that danger and commotion, sometimes the hardest part is going home by yourself, being alone in all that quiet.
I guess so.
So, what do you say we go someplace where it's not so quiet?
Should be just in time for the morning rush at the coffee shop.
I don't want to talk about yesterday, though.
That's okay.
We can just have breakfast and not talk about it together.
What do you say?
 Okay.
 All right.
Um, tell him to call me later, and maybe I'll answer.
Hey. You're up.
Okay.
 And you're safe.
 Yeah.
I was so worried.
I'm, uh... I'm okay.
Just glad it's over.
The news wasn't clear about what started the whole thing.
There were riots?
Yeah, orchestrated by this guy who wanted to break out and see his kid.
Are you serious?
 Yeah.
 So, did it work?
Did he get to see his kid?
No.
No, he, uh... he shot himself before he made it inside.
Dad?
Yeah.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Just, um...
I'm really glad you're my kid.
 You're weird, Dad.
