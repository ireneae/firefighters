Is anyone injured? <i> No, not yet.</i> Can you describe the suspects? <i> I don't know.</i> <i>Boys. Maybe six or seven years old.</i> And they have guns?
Yes! They have those giant water cannon things.
<i>-They almost took my eye out.
I'm sorry.</i> But are you reporting an actual emergency?
<i>Of course it's an emergency!</i> It's almost something with these people!
If it's not water guns, it's water balloons or roller skates or tricycles and too many damn barbecues!
<i>Just one big damned unlawful assembly.</i> If you would like to make a noise complaint, you should call-- <i> I'm calling you.</i> And now, I'd like to speak to your supervisor.
Ma'am, it's a misdemeanor under California penal code, section 148.3, for a person to use the 9-1-1 system for a purpose other than reporting an actual emergency.
<i>Are you kidding me? I'm the criminal now?</i> <i>Okay, fine, if you people aren't gonna handle it,</i> <i>I will take care of it myself.</i> Ma'am-- <i> Hey!</i> <i>How'd you get in here?</i> <i>Get outta here!</i> May-- No--dispatching units now.

<i>♪</i> Gunshot wound to the chest.
She was already dead when we got here.
Don't think you're gonna be needing those med kits.
Yeah, Crime Scene unit's on the way.
We just need to get a medical confirmation that she's dead.
On it.
Excuse me.
Uh, did you just say "excuse me"?
Chimney's being weird.
How can you tell?
Ooh, ooh, hey, whoever killed her kicked that gate in good.
Saw a clean footprint on it.
Well, that foot would be mine.
The gate was latched shut from the inside.
Front door was locked too.
If everything was locked when you got here, how'd the murderer get in or out?
It's a locked-room mystery.
A locked-yard mystery. what do you think?
Home invasion gone bad? Murder for hire.
Was she married? 'Cause... you know.
The husband is usually the culprit.
Are we making a true crime podcast?
Calling it--definitely some signs of struggle.
Looks like a fresh manicure, too.
Guessing that the broken nail would have bugged her less than the bullet hole.
You got an ID for the paperwork?
Yeah, the victim's name is Delia Narwood.
She's the owner and sole occupant of the property.
And a... apparent fan of tiny garden statuary.
How you doin', Rick?
Nice to see ya, Bobby.
Hey, you know, none of this mail's addressed to Delia Narwood--it's not even the right house number.
So she was stealing people's mail.
Maybe she saw something she wasn't supposed to...
and it got her killed.
Okay, Cagney and Lacey.
I think your work here is done. All right.
Let's saddle up.
So she was on the phone with 9-1-1, not about an intruder, when she was shot.
What are the odds? Well...
Ms. Narwood treated 9-1-1 like her own personal grievance hotline.
I say the odds of her dying with them on the line were above average.
How many calls from this address?
13. In the last six months.
13?
Yeah.
I wonder which one got her killed.
So, uh, you goin' over to Buck's?
Yeah. I need to tell him that our parents are coming to visit.
That's the thing you need to tell him?
Not that other thing that you told me that I'm not allowed to talk about?
And yet, here you are... talking about it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess I haven't had 29 years of practice at lying to Buck.
You know that I didn't have a choice in that.
I promised my parents.
When you were nine!
A promise they had no right to ask you to make, by the way.
You don't owe them anything. You could tell him the truth!
All I need to tell him is that our parents are coming to LA.
How do you think he's gonna take it?
You invited Mom and Dad to visit?
Yes.
And you're just telling me now.
Well, you know, you were in Texas, and... I wasn't completely sure they were coming.
You're just telling me now that they have crossed the California state line, and it's too late for me to talk you out of it.
Though... I'm still not sure who talked you into it.
No one.
I guess I just...
want my little girl to have a normal family.
You know, uncles and grandparents that she might actually know.
Well, then maybe you shoulda gotten knocked up by a guy who has one of those.
Well, that is not funny.
Maybe...
maybe this'll be a good thing, you know?
You could talk to Mom and Dad, tell them how you've been feeling.
Could be good for your therapy, right?
Or cause me to need more of it.
I think I'm willing to try.
And...
maybe Mom and Dad are too.
Fine.
But we're a team, okay?
A-a united front.
You are not allowed to leave me alone with them.
I won't, I promise.
And don't worry. Chimney's gonna be there too.
And Albert.
Albert's coming?
<i>♪ Here we go, it's tricky to rock a rhyme ♪</i> <i>♪ To rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky ♪</i> Okay, so why must I be there?
Because.
I have to meet Maddie's family. You're my family.
Ergo, you have to meet Maddie's family.
Is this a punishment?
Yes!
Now, shut up and dribble.
You know, Buck was right. You are being weird.
He thinks you're hiding something.
<i>♪ It's tricky to rock a rhyme ♪</i> <i>♪ It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky ♪</i> Because I am!
Maddie told me a secret, a really terrible, life-altering Buckley family secret that Buck can never know about.

Everybody knows I can't keep a secret!
Except this time, I really have to.
I can't tell anyone.
Except you.
Oh... no.
What do you mean, no?
I can't tell Hen or Bobby about it.
We all work with Buck.
Yeah, and I live with Buck.

On the phone with Dr. Copeland.
Emergency therapy session.
Again?
Yeah.
He had to ask her for advice on some, uh, de-escalation techniques. What, is he afraid his parents' visit is gonna turn into a hostage situation?
What?
What do you think they're like?
The parents, I mean.
I mean, I look at Maddie...
and then I look at Buck, and I'm like...
"There's a story there." You have no idea.
None of us has any idea.
Just too bad, 'cause you know...
if we <i>all</i>knew, we could talk about what we know, and then we'd all know it.
No one would be stuck keeping anything to themselves, alone, with no one to talk to about some potentially explosive information they really wish they didn't know.
<i>♪</i> I gotta go.
<i>♪</i> Do we even wanna know what that was about?
No.
Definitely not. Kay.
It seemed like such a silly call at first, a complaint about some kids, and then someone shot her.
What?
This woman died while you were on the phone with her?
Yeah. I mean, Josh was on the call, too, and he said I did everything right, but...
all I keep thinking is, "What if I'd sent police sooner?" Dad, don't-- Hey, you know, am I allowed to be a little bit concerned that my daughter just heard her first homicide?
No.
No?
No!
Look, I can't have you and Mom mad at me about this.
You promised me you'd be supportive, so... Dad up.
Okay. Okay.
Dadding up.
Josh was on the call with you, right?
Okay, so he could have jumped in if you missed something.
Yes, and Josh said that too.
I just don't know how to shake off the feeling that there was something else that I could've done, you know?
Oh, baby, your life is just moving beyond my level of experience.
I mean, you were never a first responder, but you were married to one.
Mom must have talked to you about this stuff.
Not really.
She never brought that kinda stuff home.
She always said she left her job behind when she took off the uniform at the end of the day.
All I have is a polo.
Listen.
Baby, I don't know what to tell you except maybe ask your mother.
<i>♪</i> You get the files I sent you?
Took me a while to get through 'em all.
How many lawsuits can one woman file against her neighbors-- complaints to the building department, zoning board, and for some reason, the Department of Waste Management?
Come on, Athena, everybody knows you're supposed to bring your trash cans in before 8:00 p. m.
Yeah. I see she also filed some police reports too.
Yeah. Delia Narwood was waging war against the entire cul-de-sac.
Let's go find out who decided to return fire.
She said we were running an unlicensed business out of our home.
All sidewalk vendors require business, tax, and health permits.
Do ya have those permits?
<i>She traumatized my daughter...</i> over a lemonade stand?
What kind of person does that?
I think she was just deeply unhappy.
You know the type-- they're miserable, and they want everyone else to be miserable too.
We won her over in the end, though...
with baked goods.
Zucchini bread.
Baking has become Rita's new obsession.
Every time I turn around, she's covered in flour.
Well, we're just home so much more than I thought we'd be, I figured I needed a hobby.
The sourdough-- super challenging.
Because the starter, it's really hard to feed and keep alive-- So..
the day of the block party.
Yes.
Such a lovely gathering.
I mean, up until the...
murder. That was Delia.
Never missed an opportunity to ruin things for everyone else.
It's no wonder so many people wished her ill.
Yeah, she totally had it comin'.
Joe, they're here investigating a murder.
Maybe you shouldn't-- Well, they know we didn't kill her.
You do know that, right?
We saw the police report you filed.
We know what she did.
Archie!
Please tell me you didn't get into her yard again.
Oh, my God, Archie!
Oh, my God!
What's wrong?
Archie!
<i>She poisoned him.</i> If we hadn't got him to the vet when we did...
Who does that to a dog?
And you had words with her afterwards?
I said I hoped she'd burn in Hell.
And look... wishes come true.
So we've got someone who steals mail, terrorizes small children, and poisons adorable dogs, and that's our victim.
Meanwhile, all of our suspects have alibis-- each other.
<i>Murder on the Orient Express.</i> Maybe they all did it.
I got wine--red, white, sparkling, in case you wanna do any celebratory toasts, and tequila.
Not sure why we needed two bottles.
Those are for me.
You're wearing jeans.
Well, I was told I was not allowed to wear jeans.
You stop whining. Pre-heat the oven.
350. Whoa!
We're baking stuff?
Baked brie.
Fig jam.
When did you start liking fig?
Hey.
And I think we're ready.
Dad!
Maddie.
Mom! You guys did not have to bring presents.
We're grandparents now. Spoiling comes with the job.
Mr. and Mrs. Buckley, hi, I'm Howard Han.
It's nice to finally meet you both.
Hi, Howard. Please let me get these for you.
Thank you. Thanks.
Hey. Evan.
You look good.
Ah, so do you.
Uh, this is my brother Albert.
And Buck's roommate.
It's a pleasure to meet you both.
Buck. You're still letting people call you that.
It's just a nickname, Mom. Ugh.
Oh, you guys don't like nicknames?
But Maddie-- Is the name on my birth certificate.
Would anyone like a drink?
We have many options.
I believe I'll start with tequila.
So Howard, do...
people call you Howard?
Yes. Yes, they do.
Please, this way.
Mrs. Buckley.
We got this.
United front.
I'm glad you guys had a nice drive.
We saw a lot of the country.
The first few days, there was nothing but rain, then we got here, blue skies and sunshine.
Yeah, we had a lotta rain earlier in the year, but, uh, lately, it's been dry.
Hmm.
I-I can't believe you drove all the way across the country in an RV--that sounds exciting.
Statistically speaking, it seemed the safest way to travel right now.
Yeah. We didn't wanna take any chances, given Maddie's condition and it being a high-risk pregnancy.
Well, no, it's not really high-risk-- Oh, she's over 35.
That puts her at a higher risk, so we all need to be extra careful.
The baby's fine, Mom. But you don't wanna take any chances.
Not when you've waited this long.
Wow.
Uh, she was just waiting for the right time.
The right guy.
God knows it wasn't Doug.
Okay.
Let's not talk about him.
Of course, I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm so happy to see you happy.
Now, Evan, Maddie tells us that you've been seeing a therapist?
She did?
I'm gonna get some water.
Anything we should be worried about there?
No. Ha ha, no. Of course not.
It's--that's the job, you know? It can be stressful.
It's--it's good to try and get ahead of it.
You know, your father and I went to see a therapist.
Uh, really? When?
Well, after all this business with Maddie and the husband who shall not be named, we felt like there were some things we needed to work through.
So you... you went and talked to a therapist about my problems?
It wasn't as if you wanted to talk to us about them.
Buck had to call to tell us that Doug was dead.
Well, I didn't want you to find out on <i>Dateline.</i> You know what, I'm gonna start bringing this stuff into the kitchen.
Would anybody like a refill while I'm in there?
I'll help.
Yeah, uh...
me--me too.
Evan seems good.
After you called, I was expecting...
I don't know what.
But he seems fine.
Yeah, I think he's better at that than we think.
Seeming fine.
Hey.
Hey.
Got a call about our crime scene this morning.
A uni was driving by and noticed someone had broken the seal on the front door.
Someone broke into Delia's house?
Mm-hmm. Ransacked the place.
Well, why do you look so happy about it?
'Cause when I went over to see what was missing...
I found... this.
Hmm. Some kinda white powder?
Uh-huh. Smelled like flour.
With a hint of sourdough.
Baking has become Rita's new obsession.
Zucchini bread.
Whatever Rita the baker was looking for has gotta be in one of these boxes.
The techs took everything outta that house that wasn't nailed down.
Hmm. Crowder.
What?
I have an open envelope here addressed to Jeanine R. Crowder.
I don't remember talking to anyone with that last name.
Do you?
No. What was the house number?
24320.
That's, um...
Rita Ambrose.
Nope.
Jeanine Crowder.
Wanted for larceny, fraud, identity theft, <i>and</i>bigamy.
Rita is not Rita.
And Delia didn't just know that.
She had the evidence to prove it.
Evidence that Rita didn't want us to find.
Rita!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
My wife is not a murderer!
Sorry to have to be the bearer of bad news, but she is also not your wife.
She's under arrest for bigamy.
You know about Marshall? We thought your other husband's name was Jerome.
Oh. Damn it, now you know about him too.
Rita!
Honey.
I can explain everything.
Found the gun in the kitchen. Okay.
That one might be a little harder to explain.
Hey.
Hey.
Didn't expect you home so early.
Thought you were at some pool party.
Yeah. Didn't feel like staying.
Is Mom home?
No, she's at work tonight.
Is everything okay?
I took that call the other day.
The lady who got shot and fell into her pool?
Mm, yeah, pool party maybe not the thing to take your mind off your job.
I get that I need to learn how to let go, you know, take off the uniform and leave the job behind.
Well, that is certainly how your mother does it.
I-I've never been able to compartmentalize that much.
Okay, well, how do you do it?
I mean, you've been a first responder a really, really long time, so...
I mean, not that you're...
Yes, it's true.
I have been doing this job longer than you've been alive.
But no, I didn't always know how to deal with the stresses that come with it. For a long time, my coping mechanism was a mix of vodka and Percocet.
Which I do not recommend.
Copy that.
May, it's natural...
to go over the losses in your head, to think about all the things you could have done differently knowing now what you didn't know then.
I keep trying to figure out what I could have done better, how I could have saved her.
You couldn't.
You're gonna lose people, and it is never gonna feel okay.
But that doesn't mean it's your fault.
It just means that you care.
And there is nothing wrong with that.
Big day. You ready?
Uh, yeah, I guess. Why is it a big day?
Oh, no. Here.
This is you.
That's not the training desk.
Congratulations, graduate.
Today you fly solo.
But...
the shooting call-- You did everything right.
So trust your instincts. Trust yourself.

<i>Oh, sorry. I buried the lede.</i> <i>My name is Stanley Whitworth,</i> <i>and I just planted a bomb.</i> They found the guy's house. No sign of him.
They went to his job, and it turns out he was fired last month.
Did they find the bomb?
No. The place was clear.
I guess maybe it was just some kind of revenge prank.
Didn't sound like a prank to me.
I think maybe we have the wrong job.
I was looking at his social media.
You should not be doing that.
This isn't the first time he's lost a job.
Probably half a dozen of them in the last two years.
What was the first job he lost?
Clearing the building now, but we need to shut off gas and power as a precaution.
Eddie, you're on electrical--Buck, I want you to go up the street, shut the gas off at the main.
Copy that.
I mean, I know Stan was angry, but... it's Stan!
He was with us for almost 20 years until the accident.
He was injured on the job.
Blamed the company for cutting corners.
Filed a grievance over it.
The company said it was his mistake.
So when they fired him, he lost his health and pension.
Court threw out his claim on Friday.
He must have snapped.
What'd he do for the company?
He was in charge of demolition on our job sites.
He'd blow things up for you.
Yes.
BP's elevated. It's probably just the stress.
But I'll keep an eye on her until we can transport.
Cap, power's out, but I just got word that a janitor might have had an asthma attack <i>and collapsed in one of the stairwells.</i> Copy that. Sending Chimney your way.

Yeah. Building is almost clear.
No sign of any explosives yet.

I'll let the Cap know.
Wait, wait, wait!

He's in there with the bomber.
We all gotta die of something, right?
Looks like you've already picked your preferred method.
Hey, so, uh, so this respiratory distress--asthma?
Or is that why you filed your grievance?
I was born with it.
The accident's how they got rid of me.
They call themselves a family company, but...
that's a buncha crap.
Hey, look, it's getting worse, okay?
I can just-- No, no.
It's over.
The world's gotta know the truth.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I get it.
You're like a ticking time bomb.
If you don't get the truth out, you're just gonna burst.
You don't know nothin' about it.
Wanna bet?
In fact, you got a minute?
I need to get my men in there and get a bead on this guy.
Not until we find out what's happened with my guy.
Did you see anything?
The guy was breathing hard.
I don't think he was faking that.
Yeah, definitely had something in his hand, probably a bomb, or at least a detonator on him.
Why wouldn't Han just run?
I don't know.
He doesn't know?
He has no idea.
No. They kept it from him.
His entire life.
The sister too?
Wow.
And then she goes and tells me.
What'd you even say?
What was I supposed to say, huh?
Hey, is that a dead man's trigger or--?
I just figured he wanted me outta there.
A plunger means he controls it. A dead man's trigger is designed so that-- I'm familiar, Buck.
Okay. My guys got a partial visual with infrared.
He said they're just... sitting there.
Might be talking. Talking him down.
Could be just buying us some time.
What do you think they're talking about?
He never asked about it? Never suspected a thing?
No. He was just a little kid. I mean, there's a big age gap between him and his sister, so...
Ha. You sure you wanna be part of this family?
Well...
Maddie's pretty great.
I'm really looking forward to being a dad.
If I can just make it through this visit.
Hell, if I can just make it through dinner with them.
Wait, wait, wait.
Another family gathering?
Whew. Wow.
That is...
Very explosive. Yes, very.
Copy that.
Company searched their job site.
Discovered 6 pounds of C4 missing.
Well, he knew exactly where to find it.
Maybe Chimney needs to stop talking to him.
Could set him off.
Sorry. Uh, bad choice of words.
You gotta tell him. He deserves to know.
I feel terrible about it.
And I have been dying to tell somebody!
I can help you get it off your chest.
Thanks, Stan.
Hey, listen, it sounds like your chest ain't doing so well.
Just one hit.
It's not a trick.
It'll help you.
Just albuterol.
We all got problems, Stan.
Yours don't give you the right to blow up innocent people.
Or me.
All clear, all clear. We're comin' out.
Thanks for listening to me, Stan.
Is that-- Hey, are you Buck?
Please sit back. That's it.
Uh, yeah, that's me.
Ha ha. So it's true. What's true?
Okay, that O2 must really be kickin' in.
In ya go, Stanley! You're not lyin'.
Not lying about what? Nothin'--gotta go!
Nice to meet you, Buck.
It's about Buck.
What?
The thing you know. The thing that's been killing you for the last few days.
It's about Buck.
I'm sorry. I would love nothing more than to unburden myself to you right now, but I made a promise.
Are you mad?
I'm impressed.
You're growing as a human right before my eyes.
Think it's ever okay to keep a secret from someone you care about?
It depends on what the secret is and why you're keeping it.
They all think they're protecting him.
Like lying to him means the truth can't hurt him.
But you think they're wrong?
I think there's a reason why he feels alone.
He is. He's the only one not in on it.
Also, I'm not in on it. For the record.
Whatever "it" is...
you keep that to yourself.
<i>Yes, I was married to three men at once,</i> and yes, I ransacked Delia's house.
But I didn't kill her.
<i>You sure you wanna talk to me</i> <i>-without a lawyer present?
I am a lawyer.</i> Was. Kansas. It was another life.
Yeah, you've had quite a few of those.
Like a damned cat.
This gun is registered to you.
Or should I say to...
Conchita Terrano?
Also known as you.
<i>I said I didn't kill her!</i> <i>But your gun killed her.</i> The same gun we found in your pantry.
You see the problem here.
I didn't have the gun when she was shot.
She had it.
So how'd she end up with your gun?
<i>She was stealing my mail and using it to blackmail me.</i> We're done, Delia.
I'm not gonna give you any more money.
Melvin's gonna notice soon, and I cannot let that happen.
But he's not gonna notice the gunshot when you fire that thing?
Or my blood all over you when you go home...
after you kill me?
Oh-- And if you broke my gnome, I'm gonna sue you for that too.
Go home, Rita.
Stick to what you're good at-- conning stupid men.
So Delia had your gun on the night she was killed.
How'd you get it back?
<i>Melvin and I were on the porch</i> <i>-when we heard the shot.</i> What was that?
I don't know.
Um... I'm gonna call 9-1-1.
But you didn't call anyone.
Uh, yeah.
I thought Delia shot someone with my gun.
I needed to find out.
<i>Delia kept her place locked,</i> <i>but John and Joe didn't.</i> <i>I looked over the fence, and...</i> <i>she was dead.</i> <i>You know the only thing worse</i> <i>than Delia killing someone with my gun?</i> <i>Delia getting killed by my gun.</i> <i>I knew how that would look. I had to get it back.</i> Not now, Archie.
[gasps, whispers] Seriously?
Hey, Archie! Archie, Archie.
Go get it. Good boy.
Okay. Oh, God.
<i>That's a hell of a story, I'll give you that.</i> <i>You got anything to back it up?</i> Well, there's the dog toy.
I'll have the officers take you back.
<i>Uh, just a second.</i> Could you show me your hands, please?
Thank you.
You believe her story?
It might sound crazy, but I kinda do.
Why'd you ask me about her hands?
Ballistics mentioned that a piece of fingernail got caught in the gun slide.
Rita had all her fingernails.
But our victim didn't.
Delia was holding the gun when it was fired.
Think about it. On the 9-1-1 call, she said...
Okay, fine! If you people aren't gonna handle this, I'll have to do it myself.
<i>So she's had enough.</i> She wants to put the fear of God into her neighbors.
She grabs the gun, but before she can go out into the street, she's confronted by someone.
<i>-She spins around.
Hey!</i> <i>She's startled.
Hey! Stop!</i> <i>She trips over her damn garden gnome.</i> <i>She loses her balance.</i> <i>And then the gun goes off.</i> It's not the craziest story I ever heard.
It's definitely close.
Okay, so the only thing we don't know is who she was yelling at.
Everybody else is accounted for.
They were all at the block party.
Not... everyone.
Ss, ss, ss, ss.
The dog was in her yard. That's who she was shouting at.
I gotta put that in my report.
Don't worry, Archie.
Not a jury in the world is gonna convict.
Well, I'm just glad everybody's okay.
You all seem to have very dangerous jobs.
Not really. I mean, most of the time, it's pretty run of the mill.
Yeah. And Stan wasn't a bad guy.
He just... needed someone to see him.
To understand how much pain he was in.
He probably wasn't gonna blow the place up.
Still seems... very risky.
I mean, from what I hear, Evan has spent quite a lot of time in hospitals.
From what you hear?
'Cause you coulda come.
Seen for yourself.
Evan, I've told you-- You, uh, you're not good with hospitals.
I got it.
I'm not good seeing my children in them.
You don't know! Mom, Mom.
I'm fine.
I'm ready for dessert.
Oh, Howard, where'd you put that box we brought?
Dad, more gifts?
Not exactly.
It's over by the couch. Let me grab it.
I like him, Maddie.
Me too.
You picked a good one this time.
Mom-- What?
It was a compliment, Evan.
Oh, was it?
Ugh!
Your baby box.
I thought you might wanna pass on some of these things to your little girl someday.
Aw!
Oh, this is cool.
I-I didn't know you made these for us.
When do I get mine?
Hey, you're not even a grown up yet.
They're probably still adding stuff to it.
I can't believe you kept all this.
You thought we'd throw it away?
We may not have agreed with all the choices you made, Maddie, but we never gave up hope that you'd come to your senses.
And you did.
You never gave up hope?
Evan, let's not do this.
United front, remember?
You guys didn't even go to her wedding.
Oh.
She was making a terrible mistake.
We told her that.
Yeah, people make mistakes.
Doesn't mean you give up on 'em.
But you did.
She married Doug, and you cut her off.
At the time, we thought it was... for the best.
We didn't know what was going on.
I swear, Maddie.
We didn't know he was hurting you.
Well, you should have.
You shoulda known!
You shoulda known!
You were right there in the same town.
How could you not know? Actually, you know what?
Maybe it does track, 'cause you barely knew what was going on with your own kids when we <i>were</i>under the same roof.
Maybe you never gave up hope...
You sure as hell gave up on her.
You gave up on both of us.
Oh, and, uh, and you wanna know why I'm really in therapy?
It is because I have spent my entire life feeling like a constant disappointment.
And you wanna talk about our jobs?
You think my job is dangerous?
I have <i>walked</i>through <i>fire</i> every single day of my life because of you.
That is why I am in therapy.
Because nothing I ever did was good enough! We tried.
But you always-- You never made it easy on us.
Either one of you.
We were supposed to? We were kids.
Evan, I don't know what you expected us to do!
Love me anyway.
<i>♪</i> I can't.
Oh-- <i>♪</i> Boom.
Tell Mom and Dad how you feel!
It'll be a fresh start! Ah!
Two dinners.
That's all it took, two dinners, and I am 12 years old again, trapped between my sister and my parents.
And now... planning my awkward apology.
What do you have to apologize for?
Did you say anything that wasn't true?
No, but-- Well, look.
Maybe you could've come at it a little differently, but if that's how you feel, how they made you feel, you have every right to say so.
Yeah, I don't need any more therapy.
Tuh! Tuh!
I just wanna hit things.
I've been down that road.
I don't recommend it.
Maddie again?
Yeah.
She's worried about me.
Ah!
Can't imagine why.
Heading out, Sergeant Grant?
Uh, yeah. Been a long couple of days.
Oh, by the way. Congratulations.
We apprehended a corgi, Williams.
I'm not sure anyone's getting a medal for that one.
A dog? What? I was talking about your daughter.
She saved a lotta people yesterday.
You must be proud.
Yeah. I am.
<i>♪</i> <i>May?</i> Hey, Mom, what's up?
Can you come down here? I wanna talk to you.
Surprise! Surprise!
Whoa!
Congratulations!
What-what is this?
A little birdie told me that you finished your training.
Congratulations, baby. I'm proud of you.
You saved like 100 people.
37, but yes, big save.
Now, we didn't have time to order you something custom, so we got you some cupcakes.
Oh, my gosh!
Thank you! Well, don't look at me.
No, Bobby was not the one that told me about your big call.
Mom-- I wish you would've told me yourself.
I mean, you know I'm here whenever you need me, right?
Yes, I do. I just...
I needed to find my way without you.
And you did.
I'm proud of you.
Me too.
<i>Are you okay?</i> Embarrassed, mostly, about the way I went off on Mom and Dad.
You don't have to defend me. I can take care of myself.
Well, you shouldn't have to. Not from your own parents.
But I'm sorry.
I know you're trying to fix things with them.
Not just for me. For you too.
You shouldn't have to carry the weight of their mistakes.
You deserve better than that.
Yeah, well...
And you have never...
you've never been a disappointment.
You know, I-I gotta say, uh...
This was a surprise.
Never knew Mom and Dad were so sentimental.
Yeah, they used to be... different.
Different how?
Happier.
I mean, maybe they weren't.
You take things on differently as a kid.
Ho ho ho, hey! There's a handsome devil.
That's not supposed to be in-- Oh!
No pictures of me allowed in your baby box.
Selfish! Ha.
This doesn't look like our house.
When-when was this taken?
1988?
That can't be right. I wasn't even born yet.
Maddie.
Maddie, who--who is this?
That's Daniel.
He died.
He was our brother.
