We just need to get a medical confirmation that she's dead.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: On it.
Excuse me.

(<em>quietly</em>) Chimney's being weird.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: How can you tell?
Ooh, ooh, hey, whoever killed her kicked that gate in good.
Saw a clean footprint on it.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Well, that foot would be mine.
The gate was latched shut from the inside.
Front door was locked too.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: If everything was locked when you got here, how'd the murderer get in or out?
It's a locked-room mystery.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: A locked-yard mystery. What do you think?
Home invasion gone bad? Murder for hire.
<strong>Buck</strong>: Was she married? 'Cause... you know.
The husband is usually the culprit.

<strong>Hen</strong>: Calling it... definitely some signs of struggle.
Looks like a fresh manicure, too.
Guessing that the broken nail would have bugged her less than the bullet hole.
<strong>Hen</strong>: You got an ID for the paperwork?
Yeah, the victim's name is Delia Narwood.
She's the owner and sole occupant of the property.
And a... apparent fan of tiny garden statuary.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: (<em>chuckles</em>) How you doin', Rick?
<strong>Rick</strong>: Nice to see ya, Bobby.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Hey, you know, none of this mail's addressed to Delia Narwood... it's not even the right house number.

What are the odds?
<strong>Athena</strong>: Well...
Ms. Narwood treated 9-1-1 like her own personal grievance hotline.
I say the odds of her dying with them on the line were above average.

No one. (<em>sighs</em>)

You know, uncles and grandparents that she might actually know.
Well, then maybe you shoulda gotten knocked up by a guy who has one of those.
Well, that is not funny.
Maybe... maybe this'll be a good thing, you know?
You could talk to Mom and Dad, tell them how you've been feeling.
Could be good for your therapy, right?
Or cause me to need more of it.
I think I'm willing to try.
And... maybe Mom and Dad are too.

Took me a while to get through 'em all.
How many lawsuits can one woman file against her neighbors...
Complaints to the building department, zoning board, and for some reason, the Department of Waste Management?
Come on, Athena, everybody knows you're supposed to bring your trash cans in before 8:00 p.m.
Yeah. I see she also filed some police reports too.
Yeah. Delia Narwood was waging war against the entire cul-de-sac.
Let's go find out who decided to return fire.
<strong>Sandi</strong>: She said we were running an unlicensed business out of our home.
All sidewalk vendors require business, tax, and health permits.
Do ya have those permits?
<strong>Sandi</strong>: <em>She traumatized my daughter...</em> over a lemonade stand?
What kind of person does that?
I think she was just deeply unhappy.
You know the type... they're miserable, and they want everyone else to be miserable too.
We won her over in the end, though... with baked goods.
Zucchini bread.
Baking has become Rita's new obsession.
Every time I turn around, she's covered in flour.
Well, we're just home so much more than I thought we'd be, I figured I needed a hobby.
The sourdough... super challenging.
Because the starter, it's really hard to feed and keep alive...
So..
The day of the block party.
Yes.
Such a lovely gathering.
I mean, up until the... murder.
<strong>Melvin</strong>: That was Delia.
Never missed an opportunity to ruin things for everyone else.
It's no wonder so many people wished her ill.
Yeah, she totally had it comin'.
<strong>John</strong>: Joe, they're here investigating a murder.
Maybe you shouldn't...
Well, they know we didn't kill her.
You do know that, right?
We saw the police report you filed.
We know what she did.
Archie!
Please tell me you didn't get into her yard again.
(<em>whining</em>)
Oh, my God, Archie!
Oh, my God!
<strong>John</strong>: What's wrong?
Archie!

<strong>John</strong>: <em>She poisoned him.</em>
If we hadn't got him to the vet when we did...
Who does that to a dog?
And you had words with her afterwards?
I said I hoped she'd burn in Hell.
And look... wishes come true.
So we've got someone who steals mail, terrorizes small children, and poisons adorable dogs, and that's our victim.
Meanwhile, all of our suspects have alibis...
Each other.
<strong>Rick</strong>: <em>Murder on the Orient Express.</em>
Maybe they all did it.
I got wine... red, white, sparkling, in case you wanna do any celebratory toasts, and tequila.
Not sure why we needed two bottles.
Those are for me.
You're wearing jeans.
Well, I was told I was not allowed to wear jeans.

You look good.
Ah, so do you.

It's a pleasure to meet you both.
Buck. You're still letting people call you that.
It's just a nickname, Mom.
<strong>Margaret</strong>: Ugh.
Oh, you guys don't like nicknames?
But Maddie...
Is the name on my birth certificate.
Would anyone like a drink?
We have many options.
I believe I'll start with tequila.
<strong>Phillip</strong>: So Howard, do... people call you Howard?
Yes. Yes, they do.
Please, this way.
Mrs. Buckley.
<strong>Maddie</strong>: We got this.
<strong>Buck</strong>: United front.
I'm glad you guys had a nice drive.
We saw a lot of the country.
<strong>Margaret</strong>: The first few days, there was nothing but rain, then we got here, blue skies and sunshine.
Yeah, we had a lotta rain earlier in the year, but, uh, lately, it's been dry.
Hmm.
I-I can't believe you drove all the way across the country in an RV... that sounds exciting.
<strong>Phillip</strong>: Statistically speaking, it seemed the safest way to travel right now.
Yeah. We didn't wanna take any chances, given Maddie's condition and it being a high-risk pregnancy.
Well, no, it's not really high-risk...
Oh, she's over 35.
That puts her at a higher risk, so we all need to be extra careful.
The baby's fine, Mom.
<strong>Margaret</strong>: But you don't wanna take any chances.
Not when you've waited this long.
(<em>mouths</em>) Wow.
Uh, she was just waiting for the right time.
The right guy.
God knows it wasn't Doug.
Okay.
Let's not talk about him.
Of course, I'm sorry. (<em>chuckles</em>) I'm just...
I'm so happy to see you happy.
Now, Evan, Maddie tells us that you've been seeing a therapist?
She did?
I'm gonna get some water.
Anything we should be worried about there?
No. Ha ha, no. Of course not.
It's... that's the job, you know? It can be stressful.
It's... it's good to try and get ahead of it.
You know, your father and I went to see a therapist.
Uh, really? When?
Well, after all this business with Maddie and the husband who shall not be named, we felt like there were some things we needed to work through.
So you... you went and talked to a therapist about my problems?
<strong>Phillip</strong>: It wasn't as if you wanted to talk to us about them.
Buck had to call to tell us that Doug was dead.
Well, I didn't want you to find out on <em>Dateline.</em>
<strong>Chimney</strong>: You know what, I'm gonna start bringing this stuff into the kitchen.
Would anybody like a refill while I'm in there?
I'll help.
Yeah, uh... me... me too.
Evan seems good.
After you called, I was expecting...
(<em>exhales</em>) I don't know what.
But he seems fine.
Yeah, I think he's better at that than we think.
Seeming fine.
Hey.
Hey.
Got a call about our crime scene this morning.
A uni was driving by and noticed someone had broken the seal on the front door.
Someone broke into Delia's house?
Mm-hmm. Ransacked the place.
Well, why do you look so happy about it?
'Cause when I went over to see what was missing...
I found... this.
(<em>phone chimes</em>)
(<em>suspenseful music</em>)
Hmm. Some kinda white powder?
Uh-huh. Smelled like flour.
With a hint of sourdough.
Baking has become Rita's new obsession.
(<em>sighs</em>) Zucchini bread.
<strong>Rick</strong>: Whatever Rita the baker was looking for has gotta be in one of these boxes.
The techs took everything outta that house that wasn't nailed down.
Hmm. Crowder.
What?
I have an open envelope here addressed to Jeanine R. Crowder.
I don't remember talking to anyone with that last name.
Do you?
No. What was the house number?
24320.
That's, um...
Rita Ambrose.
Nope.
Jeanine Crowder.
Wanted for larceny, fraud, identity theft, <em>and</em> bigamy.
Rita is not Rita.
And Delia didn't just know that.
She had the evidence to prove it.
Evidence that Rita didn't want us to find.

<strong>Melvin</strong>: Rita!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
My wife is not a murderer!
Sorry to have to be the bearer of bad news, but she is also not your wife.
<strong>Rick</strong>: She's under arrest for bigamy.
You know about Marshall?
<strong>Athena</strong>: We thought your other husband's name was Jerome.
Oh. Damn it, now you know about him too.
Rita!
Honey.
I can explain everything.

<strong>Rita</strong>: Okay.
That one might be a little harder to explain.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Hey.
Hey.
Didn't expect you home so early.
Thought you were at some pool party.
Yeah. Didn't feel like staying.
Is Mom home?
No, she's at work tonight.
Is everything okay?
I took that call the other day.
The lady who got shot and fell into her pool?
Mm, yeah, pool party maybe not the thing to take your mind off your job.
I get that I need to learn how to let go, you know, take off the uniform and leave the job behind.
Well, that is certainly how your mother does it.
I-I've never been able to compartmentalize that much.
Okay, well, how do you do it?
I mean, you've been a first responder a really, really long time, so...
I mean, not that you're...
(<em>laughing</em>) Yes, it's true.
I have been doing this job longer than you've been alive.
But no, I didn't always know how to deal with the stresses that come with it. For a long time, my coping mechanism was a mix of vodka and Percocet.
Which I do not recommend.
Copy that.
May, it's natural... to go over the losses in your head, to think about all the things you could have done differently knowing now what you didn't know then.
I keep trying to figure out what I could have done better, how I could have saved her.
You couldn't.
You're gonna lose people, and it is never gonna feel okay.
But that doesn't mean it's your fault.
It just means that you care.
And there is nothing wrong with that.

Big day. You ready?
Uh, yeah, I guess. Why is it a big day?
Oh, no. Here.

It's not a trick.
It'll help you.
Just albuterol.
(<em>sighs</em>) We all got problems, Stan.
Yours don't give you the right to blow up innocent people.
Or me.
All clear, all clear. We're comin' out.
Thanks for listening to me, Stan.
(<em>moans</em>)
<strong>Stan</strong>: Is that... Hey, are you Buck?
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Please sit back. That's it.
Uh, yeah, that's me.
<strong>Stan</strong>: Ha ha. So it's true.
<strong>Hen</strong>: What's true?
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Okay, that O2 must really be kickin' in.
In ya go, Stanley!
<strong>Stan</strong>: You're not lyin'.
<strong>Buck</strong>: Not lying about what?
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Nothin'... gotta go!
<strong>Stan</strong>: Nice to meet you, Buck.
(<em>bell rings</em>)
(<em>indistinct chatter</em>)
(<em>indistinct P.A.</em>)
It's about Buck.
What?
The thing you know. The thing that's been killing you for the last few days.
It's about Buck.
(<em>wheezy laugh</em>)
(<em>whispering</em>) I'm sorry. I would love nothing more than to unburden myself to you right now, but I made a promise.
Are you mad?
I'm impressed.
You're growing as a human right before my eyes.
(<em>both laughing</em>)
Think it's ever okay to keep a secret from someone you care about?
It depends on what the secret is and why you're keeping it.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: They all think they're protecting him.
Like lying to him means the truth can't hurt him.
But you think they're wrong?
I think there's a reason why he feels alone.
He is. He's the only one not in on it.
Also, I'm not in on it. For the record.
Whatever &quot;it&quot; is... you keep that to yourself.
<strong>Rita</strong>: <em>Yes, I was married to three men at once,</em> and yes, I ransacked Delia's house. But I didn't kill her.
<strong>Rick</strong>: <em>You sure you wanna talk to me without a lawyer present?
I am a lawyer.</em>
Was. Kansas. It was another life.
Yeah, you've had quite a few of those.
Like a damned cat.
This gun is registered to you.
Or should I say to...
Conchita Terrano?
Also known as you.
<strong>Rita</strong>: <em>I said I didn't kill her!</em>
<strong>Rick</strong>: <em>But your gun killed her.</em>
The same gun we found in your pantry.
You see the problem here.
I didn't have the gun when she was shot.
She had it.
So how'd she end up with your gun?
<strong>Rita</strong>: <em>She was stealing my mail and using it to blackmail me.</em>
We're done, Delia.
I'm not gonna give you any more money.
Melvin's gonna notice soon, and I cannot let that happen.
But he's not gonna notice the gunshot when you fire that thing?
Or my blood all over you when you go home... after you kill me?
Oh...
And if you broke my gnome, I'm gonna sue you for that too.
Go home, Rita.
Stick to what you're good at...
Conning stupid men.
<strong>Rick</strong>: So Delia had your gun on the night she was killed.
How'd you get it back?
<strong>Rita</strong>: <em>Melvin and I were on the porch when we heard the shot.</em>
(<em>gunshot</em>)
<strong>Melvin</strong>: What was that?
I don't know.
Um... I'm gonna call 9-1-1.
But you didn't call anyone.
Uh, yeah.
I thought Delia shot someone with my gun.
I needed to find out.
<em>Delia kept her place locked, but John and Joe didn't. I looked over the fence, and... she was dead.
You know the only thing worse than Delia killing someone with my gun? Delia getting killed by my gun. I knew how that would look. I had to get it back.</em>
(<em>Archie whining</em>)
(<em>whispering</em>) Not now, Archie.
(<em>barking</em>)
(<em>gasps, whispers</em>) Seriously?
Hey, Archie! Archie, Archie.
Go get it. Good boy.
(<em>sirens wailing distantly</em>)
(<em>suspenseful music</em>)
Okay. Oh, God.
(<em>sirens approaching</em>)
<strong>Rick</strong>: <em>That's a hell of a story, I'll give you that. You got anything to back it up?</em>
Well, there's the dog toy.
I'll have the officers take you back.
(<em>phone chimes, buzzes</em>)
<em>Uh, just a second.</em>
Could you show me your hands, please?
Thank you.
<strong>Athena</strong>: You believe her story?
It might sound crazy, but I kinda do.
Why'd you ask me about her hands?
Ballistics mentioned that a piece of fingernail got caught in the gun slide.
Rita had all her fingernails.
But our victim didn't.
Delia was holding the gun when it was fired.
Think about it. On the 9-1-1 call, she said...
Okay, fine! If you people aren't gonna handle this, I'll have to do it myself.
<strong>Rick</strong>: <em>So she's had enough.</em>
She wants to put the fear of God into her neighbors.
She grabs the gun, but before she can go out into the street, she's confronted by someone.
<em>She spins around.</em>
Hey!
<strong>Athena</strong>: <em>She's startled.</em>
Hey! Stop!
<strong>Rick</strong>: <em>She trips over her damn garden gnome.</em>
<strong>Athena</strong>: <em>She loses her balance.</em>
<strong>Rick</strong>: <em>And then the gun goes off.</em>
It's not the craziest story I ever heard.
It's definitely close.
Okay, so the only thing we don't know is who she was yelling at.
Everybody else is accounted for.
They were all at the block party.
(<em>Archie whining</em>)
Not... everyone.
Ss, ss, ss, ss.
<strong>Rick</strong>: The dog was in her yard. That's who she was shouting at.
I gotta put that in my report.
Don't worry, Archie.
Not a jury in the world is gonna convict.
Well, I'm just glad everybody's okay.
<strong>Phillip</strong>: You all seem to have very dangerous jobs.
Not really. I mean, most of the time, it's pretty run of the mill.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Yeah. And Stan wasn't a bad guy.
He just... needed someone to see him.
To understand how much pain he was in.
He probably wasn't gonna blow the place up.
Still seems... very risky.
I mean, from what I hear, Evan has spent quite a lot of time in hospitals.
From what you hear?
'Cause you coulda come.
Seen for yourself.
Evan, I've told you...
You, uh, you're not good with hospitals.
I got it.
I'm not good seeing my children in them.
You don't know!
<strong>Maddie</strong>: Mom, Mom.
I'm fine.
I'm ready for dessert.
<strong>Phillip</strong>: Oh, Howard, where'd you put that box we brought?
Dad, more gifts?
Not exactly.
It's over by the couch. Let me grab it.
I like him, Maddie.
Me too.
You picked a good one this time.
Mom...
What?
It was a compliment, Evan.
Oh, was it?
Ugh!
Your baby box.
<strong>Margaret</strong>: I thought you might wanna pass on some of these things to your little girl someday.
Aw!
Oh, this is cool.
I-I didn't know you made these for us.
When do I get mine?
Hey, you're not even a grown up yet.
They're probably still adding stuff to it.
I can't believe you kept all this.
You thought we'd throw it away?
<strong>Margaret</strong>: We may not have agreed with all the choices you made, Maddie, but we never gave up hope that you'd come to your senses.
And you did.
You never gave up hope?
Evan, let's not do this.
United front, remember?
You guys didn't even go to her wedding.
Oh.
She was making a terrible mistake.
We told her that.
Yeah, people make mistakes.
Doesn't mean you give up on 'em.
But you did.
She married Doug, and you cut her off.
<strong>Phillip</strong>: At the time, we thought it was... for the best.
<strong>Margaret</strong>: We didn't know what was going on.
I swear, Maddie.
We didn't know he was hurting you.
Well, you should have.
You shoulda known!
You shoulda known!
You were right there in the same town.
How could you not know? Actually, you know what?
Maybe it does track, 'cause you barely knew what was going on with your own kids when we<em> were</em> under the same roof.
Maybe you never gave up hope...
You sure as hell gave up on her.
You gave up on both of us.
Oh, and, uh, and you wanna know why I'm really in therapy?
It is because I have spent my entire life feeling like a constant disappointment.
And you wanna talk about our jobs?
You think my job is dangerous?
I have <em>walked</em> through fire every single day of my life because of you.
That is why I am in therapy.
Because nothing I ever did was good enough!
<strong>Phillip</strong>: We tried.
But you always...
You never made it easy on us.
Either one of you.
We were supposed to? We were kids.
Evan, I don't know what you expected us to do!
Love me anyway.

That's all it took, two dinners, and I am 12 years old again, trapped between my sister and my parents.
And now... planning my awkward apology.
What do you have to apologize for?
Did you say anything that wasn't true?
No, but...
Well, look.
Maybe you could've come at it a little differently, but if that's how you feel, how they made you feel, you have every right to say so.
Yeah, I don't need any more therapy.
