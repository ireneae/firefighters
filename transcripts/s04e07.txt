When I found out about the tumor last year, people told me I should have a bucket list.
Right?
Ended up being a short list, because the only thing I ever cared about was my kids and preparing them to be without me.
But you got better.
You're still better, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course.
But when I got news that the tumor was shrinking, I created a new list.

You want that list in chronological order or order of importance?
Or how 'bout we just go with the most recent?
That I'm too old for med school, Ma?
No!
No, honey. It's not like that.
Then what?
Ah, you've...
always been different.
Serious. Focused.
Anything you wanted, you went after till you got it.
That takes a kind of dedication I ain't never had.
I've always been...
a little jealous of that.
But so proud.
I look at the amazing life you've made for yourself and I'm in awe.
You've built something, Henrietta, and I...
I just don't want you to lose it.
I don't want you to...
<i>♪</i> What, Ma, to end up like you?
I know I'm not the most practical person in the world.
I get it from my mama, who got it from her mama before her.
We live for today 'cause tomorrow's not promised.
But it turns out sometimes tomorrow shows up and bites you in the ass.
I'ma be okay.
'Cause I'm a fighter.
Like my mama.
I'm not sure you get that from me.
Your father always-- He wasn't there, Ma. You were.
I tried.
I know...
I didn't always succeed, but...
I really did try.
Remember that time I was about nine years old and I told you I didn't feel like going to school?
And you said, "You don't have to go to school, but you have to learn something every day." So we went to the library.
And then we went to the park for a picnic.
I think you read three books that day.
All because that little Forrester girl was picking on you.
How'd you know that, Ma? I didn't tell you.
I'm your mama.

Hi.
Look, I realize we haven't talked since our date, and I know it was kinda awkward.
Yeah, it was terrible.
Yeah.
Listen, I think you're great.
And we live in the same building, which could be totally weird, but it shouldn't.
No, it absolutely shouldn't.
So here.
Chocolate cheesecake.
Welcome to the neighborhood.
Thank you for everything.
I--I'm so happy right now, and I weirdly owe it all to you.
It's not every day a bad date introduces you to a great guy.
I'm sorry, a what now?
Hey, Veronica, I think you're out of conditioner.
