She was so pale. I thought she was dead.

Yes.
She had two blood spots on her belly.

You took a pretty good hit, so we should get you to the hospital, get some scans done.
No. I gotta get home.

Not a wallet or a phone. Just a keychain.

Or at least he used to be a doctor in Miami.
Made more than a few mistakes. Took his license from him.
So he moved out here about a year ago.
Started an underground clinic.
So he's been doing surgeries here for a year?
Not quite. He started out pretty simple.
Botox, filler, the occasional chemical peel.
But then he got greedy and sloppy.
More than sloppy. He almost killed that woman.
Yeah, but you got to her in time.
