("It's Beginning to Look a Lot like Christmas" playing) Thank you.
* It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas * I don't get it.
Every year. People flock to his house and take pictures. Never our house.
It's not fair. I worked just as hard as he did.
What does he have that I don't?
OLIVIA: Oh, I don't know, taste?
JOHN: He's bribing them with free food. Go make some cookies.
Let it go, John. Christmas isn't about competition.
Just be grateful for what we have.
No. I have a better idea.
* But the prettiest sight to see * * Is the holly that will be * On your own front door We got hot chocolate, hot cider and everything.
(indistinct chatter) You want to see something good?
Get a load of this.
MAN: Look!
He's up on the roof.
* It's beginning to look...
Uh-huh.
You looking? You looking?
* Soon the bells will start (exhales) * And the thing that will make them ring * * Is the carol that you sing * Right within your heart (screams) * It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. * It's this way.
(groaning) Sir, can you move at all?
It hurts.
Okay. Probably a good sign.
Just stay still. Can you tell me how this happened?
Snowman pushed me off the roof.
(groans) Blood pressure's 120/70. Respiration's good.
All right. Yeah.
Do we move him over a little bit?
Doesn't appear to be any spinal damage.
All right, let's get him on a backboard.
(whimpers, grunts) Oh, looks like the baby Jesus broke your fall.
That's a Christmas miracle.
BOBBY: You guys ready?
CHIMNEY: Yeah.
(camera clicks) (indistinct chatter) (camera clicks) Oh, look, John, you finally got your wish.
Everyone's taking pictures.
(cameras clicking) Ready to go.
This is the best Christmas ever.
Ready? One, two...
(bells jingle) (Athena laughs) That knot is the same size it was ten minutes ago.
Yeah, I'm beginning to think it's something mankind wasn't meant to tamper with.
Well, maybe you'll have better luck with your next project. (chuckles) Oh, Harry saw a YouTube review. He has been talking about nothing else for three months.
Been hiding it in the garage.
When we were kids, we got excited about lawn darts.
Lawn darts?
Yeah, you know, those metal spikes with the wings on them you'd toss across your lawn.
(chuckles) I think they stopped making them because there were so many injuries, but I loved them.
My brother was a madman. He'd throw them way up in the air, then he'd laugh at me while I freaked out, running around, not knowing where they were gonna come down.
I think this is a minimum two-hour assembly.
It's getting pretty late, so...
Maybe you could just sleep over.
We can make a night of it.
Hot chocolate, a little Nat King Cole.
Well, I like the sound of that.
Know what would be even better?
Hmm?
If you didn't have to sleep over at all 'cause you already lived here.
(chuckles) Wow.
(laughs) You look like you praying for a 911 call.
Oh, no, I'm not. I...
Well, maybe a little one. Cat in a tree.
(both chuckle) I just, you know, I get tired of having to say good night to you at the door and tired of sleeping alone in a bed made for two.
I want you in my life.
I know the idea of another family-- instant family-- probably rings a lot of bells for you after what happened.
No, 'Thena, it's not that.
You just... you just took me by surprise.
Look, I'm not trying to give you an ultimatum.
I mean, move in or else.
That's not me. That's not it.
I just wanted you to know that I was open to taking the next step.
* * Hey, take a picture * Show me what's the news today * * It's an addiction * It's a game I badly want to play * * So raise the stakes, boy * And show me what...
(music stops) (grunts) Morning, roomie.
Yeah, about that...
(panting) (knock on door) BUCK: Hey.
Looks like you're stuck with me again.
Sorry.
It's okay.
I have a new air mattress waiting for you.
You saw this coming?
You didn't?
(both laugh) Oh, we suck at this.
Really?
'Cause I feel pretty good about how that went down.
(laughs): You know what I mean.
We say we're gonna talk and work things out, but we just keep ending up like this.
It's a different way of working things out.
SHANNON (chuckles): Mm-hmm.
You're getting the tree today?
Mm-hmm.
The annual tradition of convincing him that, no, a 16-foot tree does not fit in the house.
You know, I caved one year.
(laughs) That last Christmas before you got back.
He hadn't been feeling well, and...
we missed you.
When Christopher looked up at that giant tree, I couldn't say no.
(laughs) Where'd you put it?
The backyard. (laughs) Oh, yeah.
Of course.
But we didn't have enough ornaments to cover it, so we just loaded it up with lights and ribbon.
And I got the sleeping bags out, and we laid under it, just staring up at the branches for hours.
Mm.
He must have loved that.
Yeah.
(both chuckle) (Eddie sighs) You know, he still won't tell me what he wants for Christmas.
I've tried everything.
Did you take him to see Santa?
You mean the creepy guy at the mall with a fake beard? No.
(laughs) Oh, my God.
You still haven't let that go.
Look, just because you got scared and threw up all over Santa, that doesn't mean...
First off, yeah, that was very wrong of my abuela to tell you that story.
And-and second, no.
I wasn't scared. I...
The old guy smelled bad, and I had a stomach flu.
Really? Two years in a row you had the stomach flu? Yeah?
Yeah.
(door opens) CHRISTOPHER: Daddy!
ISABEL: Eddito?
Are you here?
Why is he here? I thought you were picking him up.
I'll distract them. You-you head out the back.
Whoa, w-wait.
What?
What?
You want me to sneak out?
(knocking) That's our son out there.
Look, we've been trying to figure out how to tell him. Maybe this is the moment.
Daddy. Daddy.
Dad?
It's not the moment, okay?
You-you have to go. You have to go.
Hey. Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Thought I was supposed to pick you up at Abuela's.
ISABEL: Oh, he was so excited about decorating that he couldn't wait to get home.
Did you have company?
What?
Oh, you know, I'm not the best housekeeper.
Show... Hey, show me what you got.
ISABEL: We ended up with two Christmas trees.
He said, "This is Daddy, this is me." Yeah?
(chuckles): Aw.
Huh?
You loved this green one, didn't you?
Let's get this out of the way.
Okay.
Let me help you out, buddy.
("Wonderful Christmastime" by Paul McCartney playing) * Simply having a wonderful Christmastime * (alarm blaring) * Simply having a wonderful Christmastime * * The choir of children sing their song * (indistinct chatter) * Ding-dong * Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding... * I beg your pardon?
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
Uh...
Sir, where are you calling from?
I'm trapped inside a Christmas present.
You're what, now?
I work at West L. A. Distro on Sepulveda.
I was pulling a double shift in the warehouse, and...
Ow. Oh, I'm bleeding.
Something must have hit me on the head.
I must have passed out in one of these boxes, and it got loaded somehow.
I think I'm on a truck.
Okay.
The West L. A. Distro on Sepulveda.
Tell me your name.
Brandon Skinner.
Okay, Brandon.
You're sealed in a box, and you think you're on a truck.
Yeah. I'm getting jostled pretty good in here.
Is it a cardboard box?
Yeah.
Can you punch or kick your way out of it?
Tried. I tried!
I've been shrink-wrapped.
I'm getting a little claustrophobic.
Brandon, my name is Maddie.
Listen to my voice, and just breathe.
I can't. I can't. There's no air.
Oh, God!
Brandon, there's air.
You're talking to me, so there's air.
Stay calm. We're gonna find you.
I'll contact the warehouse, see if we can track down the truck.
Brandon, do you know how long you've been in there?
No, I just came to.
It's difficult to breathe.
I think I'm gonna pass out again.
Okay.
I don't want you to talk a lot, but I need you to try and stay awake.
We're gonna have you home for Christmas.
Ha! I hope not.
Not unless this box is going to Seattle.
You're from Seattle?
Yeah.
Going down here for school.
My mom wanted me home for Christmas break.
She offered to pay for it, but she can't afford it.
I should probably call her in case you guys don't find me in time.
We're gonna find you.
Just stay with me.
JOSH: There are trucks leaving that facility every 20 minutes.
We're working with the warehouse to try and contact all the drivers.
BRANDON: It stopped. I think we stopped.
Hey! I'm in here! Help!
(muffled shouting) (forklift beeping) (muffled shouting continues) (siren wailing) How long's he been in the air?
Plane took off from LAX 18 minutes ago.
It was diverted to SoCal Airport.
18 minutes. It's nearly long enough to reach altitude.
It's not good. Cargo isn't pressurized or heated.
I thought coach was bad.
Hey, Chim, make sure we have oh-two and warming blankets standing by.
Copy that.
(sirens wailing) (fire truck horns honking) Put your lights on. Let's go, Chim.
Come on, let's move.
Oh, joy.
Well, it looks like we're opening presents early this year, huh?
Clock is ticking, guys. We got to find this kid.
Dispatch said he was having trouble breathing even before he went up in the air.
(ringtone playing) Wait. Did you guys hear that?
(ringtone continues playing) Stethoscope?
(ringtone plays louder) That's our guy!
Hey, get this shrink-wrap off.
Got it?
What do we got?
Yeah, I got him. He's in there. He's in there.
Okay.
(grunting) I see him. He doesn't look good.
He out?
Yeah.
BOBBY: Okay. Get the bear out.
Get the bear out, guys.
All right, come on.
You ready?
One, two, three.
(ringtone continues playing) Slide him up.
He's cold, Cap.
All right, get some blankets on him.
EDDIE: I don't have a pulse.
CHIMNEY: Starting compressions.
How's he doing, Eddie?
Still nothing.
Buck, switch.
All right, switching.
Come on out, Chim.
Hold for a pulse check.
Still nothing.
I got a pulse!
Temp's rising.
Welcome back, Brandon.
I'm not dead?
BOBBY: You're not dead.
(ringtone playing) Well, someone really wants to talk to you.
BRANDON: She told me not to answer it.
Who did?
Maddie. The 911 lady.
She said she would ring it for you to find me.
Maddie?
Chim?
Oh, fancy meeting you here.
(laughs) How's Brandon?
He's good.
He's here. Do you want to talk to him?
Oh, I do.
Hi, Brandon.
Thank you.
Thank you. (laughs) You're welcome.
I look like an ornament.
Better on the tree than under it, right?
* Santa Claus is comin' to town * * Santa Claus is comin' to town * * You better watch out * You better not cry * You better not pout * I'm telling you why * Santa Claus is comin' to town... * Thank you.
Shannon. What are you doing here?
You won't answer my texts or return my calls.
This is not the place.
Maybe it's the perfect place.
Thank you.
We can actually have a conversation that doesn't end up with us in bed.
* Gonna find out who's naughty and nice... * Follow me.
* Santa Claus is comin' to town * * Oh, yeah, Santa Claus is comin' to town * * Santa Claus...
I can't do this here, not now.
Then where and when?
It's been almost two months, and right now, I feel even further away from him and from you than I ever did when we weren't speaking.
Are you ever gonna let me see Christopher?
Of course.
Eventually.
* You better not cry...
Does he know that I'm here?
I didn't want to confuse him.
Not until I was sure.
Of me? Because you seemed pretty sure when we started having sex again.
Is that how you see this? Some transaction?
What, you sleep with me so I let you see Christopher?
I thought it was a reconciliation.
Right up until the moment when... you hid me from our son.
I didn't know what else to do!
I didn't know what else to do.
And I'm not keeping you from our son like some kind of punishment.
Whatever I need to do to prove myself and to fix things, name it.
I am there.
But you and me and hiding it from him?
That is starting to make everything feel...
more broken.
You keep looking to me like I have the answers.
I don't.
No. Just the power.
I'm the one who screwed up, the one who left.
I know I don't get to have a say.
So I'm following your lead.
But... where are we going?
When will you be able to forgive me?
I can forgive you.
I'm just not sure I can trust you.
(door opens, closes) Hey, so do you need help with Christmas dinner?
Oh. No.
Is-is Bobby working that day?
I don't know.
I mean... I did a thing the other night.
It was stupid, foolish-- hell, maybe it was right-- but either way, it was thoughtless.
Okay. Well, what happened?
I asked Bobby to move in.
Move in here?
So how did he take that?
Kind of like you right now.
L-Listen, I'm just standing here wrapping these packages.
How do you know how I'm taking it?
I know that face.
(sighs) You love him.
You're moving forward.
So am I.
I mean, it's good.
But it ain't easy.
(laughs) You know, things have been going so well lately that, um, I kind of let myself forget how complicated all this is.
Yeah.
When he's here, I'm joyful, when he's not, I'm lonely.
I thought maybe he felt the same.
Hey. Hey.
Now, Bobby lived a long time with a secret.
So did I.
Who you are on the other side of that-- I mean, it takes time to figure out.
But home isn't a place.
It's a people.
And he loves you, and he loves our children.
So, if this is meant to be, he will find his way home.
HEN: Have a good night, Cap.
Bobby?
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah, you have a good night.
(Bobby sighs) I don't know where to go.
Usually, I finish my shift, check in with Athena, ask her if she wants takeout, or she wants me to cook.
Oh, you guys get into a fight or something?
She asked me to move in.
I feel like if I show up, she's gonna want an answer, and if I don't, then...
Then it'll feel like an answer?
Yeah.
And I know how much it took for her to put that out there, and the last thing I want to do is hurt her.
(inhales deeply) Bobby...
you guys deserve to be happy.
It would be great if that was together, but if it's not, if you...
if you don't see a future with her, you can't pretend that you do.
She's had enough of that.
You have to just tell her the truth.
Well, the truth is that I...
felt panic.
Well, maybe that's your answer.
BUCK: Eddie's sleeping with her, but he's lying about it.
It's like he's having an affair with his own wife.
You don't think that's weird?
CHIMNEY: I think it's none of our business.
Now can we please focus on the trees?
Now, exactly how pissed off is Maddie?
Should I be shopping for a six-foot apology, or a 12?
Uh, pissed off at you for what?
For kicking you off of my couch and onto hers.
It's an air mattress, and she is fine.
If anything, I should be the one holding a grudge, which I will if you don't hurry up and pick a tree already.
Wait. Are you seriously googling Christmas trees?
I want to buy Maddie a gift, and I want it to be perfect.
I'm gonna go find someone to help us.
You stop overthinking and just pick one.
* It's the most wonderful time of the year * * There'll be much mistletoeing and hearts will be glowing * * When loved ones are near * It's the most wonderful time of the year... * I need your help here, Big Man.
Real cute.
* There'll be parties for hosting... * Big Man like God?
Or Big Man in the Red Suit?
Blue suit, actually.
Santa Haraboji. It's a Korean thing.
Though I haven't really given him a shout-out since I was nine, but I had no idea there were so many different varieties of Christmas trees.
So it's an important purchase?
It's for a friend, but she really loves Christmas, and I want to surprise her.
A gift for the girlfriend. Nice.
No, it's not like that.
Uh, she had a rough year.
Couple of rough years, I guess.
This is our first Christmas together...
as friends, and I really, really want it to be special.
I'd go with the noble fir.
It's a classic for a reason.
* Oh, the most wonderful...
All right. Thank you for your guidance.
Jason. Jason Bailey.
* Of the year.
All right.
Noble fir it is, Jason Bailey.
* BUCK: Ho, ho, ho.
Surprise.
MADDIE: Oh.
Wow. A Christmas tree.
CHIMNEY: Yeah.
Buck said you didn't have one yet.
Uh, is this okay?
Is this the wrong kind of surprise?
No, no, no.
No. It's so sweet.
Really, I-I love that you did this.
You just didn't want it. That's okay.
I mean, we shouldn't have assumed.
I just really wasn't gonna do much Christmas this year, 'cause all of my decorations and stuff are back in Pennsylvania.
And that is why we bought everything you need.
We have lights, we have ornaments.
We even have...
an angel high for on top of the tree.
No. Angels are creepy.
CHIMNEY: You know what, I think we might have overstepped.
Maddie should be able to pick out her own decorations.
We'll just, we'll just, we'll just bring this back to the store.
What are you talking about?
You can't return a tree.
Hey, come on. You always loved Christmas, right?
Ornaments, stockings, cookies. You made your own bows.
Yeah. I'm not really feeling the holiday this year, okay?
Well, no. (scoffs) No, it's not okay.
Come on, what's going on with you?
I don't want to talk about it.
CHIMNEY: Guys, it's fine.
You know what? (grunts) I'm just gonna...
take away the evidence before, uh, this turns into a crime scene, okay.
So you hate Christmas now?
Something else I can thank Doug for, huh?
No, I don't hate Christmas, but I'm starting not to like you very much, okay?
Just let it go.
Maddie...
You can't come into my house, Buck, and act this way.
"Come into my house"?
I'm your brother.
(arguing continues) Happy holidays.
(sighs) * With your Christmas of white * But I'll have a blue...
(sighs) Bah, humbug.
* Doo-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh. * HOST (over recording): Aloha and Merry Christmas.
Romance is in the air tonight here at Terri's Tiki Room, literally.
Be sure to steal a kiss or two under the mistle-drone and celebrate the season.
Drone photos of your magic moment are available.
Ask your server.
JENNA: You hooked up with Stacy of all people.
At least she knew what she wanted.
Do you, uh, know what you want?
Be right back with your apps.
HOST (over recording): Aloha and Merry Christmas.
You like apps. Tinder, Bumble, Match.
You're still on all of them.
Yeah. I'm on them because I'm single, and I'm single because you said so.
What I said was it was too soon for Christmas with your family.
You're a commitment-phobe and you were just looking for an excuse-- a reason to check out.
HOST: And don't forget Tuesdays are two-for-one Bahama Mama and all-you-can-eat sticky ginger chicken wing night at Terri's Tiki Room.
I needed a minute.
Things were moving too fast.
I'm not phobic.
I'm afraid.
Those mean the same thing.
(scoffs) What the hell are you afraid of?
This.
(screams) EDDIE: Anything?
Not yet.
It's not like it can roll.
Maybe it bounced.
Not that bad, right?
TRAVIS: No.
And they can, they can reattach it. Right?
Yeah, the cut looks pretty clean.
We'll find the tissue, pack it in ice.
There's an excellent chance you're gonna be good as new.
A-And even if they couldn't, I wouldn't care.
Might need to up your comfort game a little there, Romeo.
Look, I didn't mean to move too fast, but I just figured when you know something, you double down.
But then you backed off.
JENNA: And you ran away.
You pushed me away.
I told you, I got scared.
Because you didn't want to be with me.
Doesn't that mean I'm supposed to let you go?
Look, may-maybe she didn't want you to move on.
She just probably needed a minute.
Well, how was he supposed to know that?
All right. Okay. All right. Listen. Look.
People aren't afraid of what they know.
They're afraid of what they don't.
It's a hard thing to hand someone else the keys to your heart and your happiness.
And then you realize that losing them would mean losing a part of yourself.
BUCK: Hey. (grunts) Found it.
* Let it snow * It doesn't show signs of stopping * Sorry, man.
Oh, sorry.
* And I've brought some corn... * That's your idea of a Christmas movie?
Holy crap. Jason... uh, Bailey.
(laughs): Yeah.
What are you talking about?
Die Hard is a holiday classic.
Really? I don't know.
I guess I always saw it as a movie about a guy trying to keep his marriage together...
with terrorists.
At Christmas.
So what are you doing here?
I thought you'd be up to your eyeballs in pine needles.
I'm just trying to find a gift for my special someone.
What about you? How did that tree go over?
Badly.
I'm not sure what to do.
I think I've really screwed things up.
Well, your boy McClane screwed things up with Holly, right?
More than once, if I recall.
But he won her back in the end, didn't he?
You know what? You're right.
I'm gonna try again.
Uh, just this.
(Chimney sighs) What's up, man? You lose something?
(chuckles) Yeah, my wallet.
Oh, no.
Here, I got it. No, I got it.
No, it's okay.
Look, I'll just, um...
There you go.
And take that so you can get out of the parking structure.
No, it's probably in my car.
In case it's not.
I can't ask you to do that.
You didn't ask, I offered.
Thanks. You know, uh, I'll come to the lot and pay you back.
Don't worry about it.
It's kind of a miracle that I ran into you.
* Let it snow, let is snow (mimics Alan Rickman): It's Christmas, Theo.
It's the time of miracles.
* Let it snow.
CHIMNEY: Thank you very much.
EDDIE: I offered to wait in line with him, but he said this is, uh, private.
Christopher.
BUCK: I really admire that kid.
I love the way he always wants to do everything on his own.
EDDIE (laughs): Yeah.
So... not gonna say anything?
Nah. About what?
You know what about.
I figured it was none of my business.
It's not.
That's what I'm saying.
It just kind of happened, okay?
It's not like I planned it.
(chuckles) I never said you did.
I only even reached out to her because I needed her help getting Christopher into his new school.
Totally understandable.
We just kind of...
ended up in bed.
Ah, these things happen.
It's not like you're breaking any commandments.
You guys are still married.
Yeah.
I'm sneaking around behind my kid's back with his mother.
Christopher doesn't know?
I don't know what he knows.
These kids sense things, right?
The other day, I made her sneak out so he wouldn't see her there.
Trying to protect your kid.
I mean, she ran out on him, right?
* I ran out first.
I ran out on both of them.
See, when Christopher was first diagnosed I was in Afghanistan.
Right at the end of my tour.
Instead of going back home...
I reenlisted.
I told myself it was to pay the bills.
But you were running away, too.
Yeah. But I got to pretend like it was for a noble cause.
Serving my country.
But when Shannon broke, nobody thought she was a hero.
She just got called evil.
And now she wants back in his life.
Yeah.
So why don't you let her?
Seems like she's already back in yours.
That's... that's what's got me confused.
Would I be doing it for Christopher or for me?
I guess sex complicates everything.
(chuckles) You said it, brother.
Uh, hey.
How'd it go, pal?
It went great.
So what'd you ask for?
Can't tell.
Santa said he'd work on it.
Oh, man...
(Buck laughs) Let's go.
Ooh.
Wah. (laughs) You two have an adorable son.
(chuckles) Um... Thank you.
Dad. Is Santa real?
Hmm?
Is Santa real? Why?
Did someone say he wasn't?
What do you think?
Do you think he's real?
W-When you were gone, I asked Santa for you to come back, and you did.
When I was in Afghanistan?
You know, buddy, Christmas wishes aren't like birthday wishes. Yeah.
You can say them out loud and they'll still come true.
I asked him to find Mom. Will he?
He's sure gonna try.
So I asked Ms. Rangley and she said it was okay to FaceTime during the performance so you can see it.
Um, what time will it be over there in a half an hour?
I don't care what time it is. I'm not missing my little girl's first solo with the choir.
I miss you, Daddy.
It's been so long.
I know.
But you just go get ready, and I promise we'll be hugging real soon.
Yeah, in a month.
Break a leg.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Surprising her?
I've been traveling for 30 hours straight.
Every form of transport you can imagine.
Jeep, Humvee, APV, helicopter, 737, and now city bus, all to make it home in time to hear my little girl sing in the choir.
Is this bus usually on time?
I've got to make the crosstown connector and I don't want to miss it.
WOMAN: Relax.
The good Lord wouldn't let you miss such an important event after all you've done to get there.
CLEMENS: Hey.
Hey, you took that man's wallet.
Piss off, Top Gun.
That's the Navy, son.
I'm a Marine.
Now give that man back his wallet and I won't call the cops.
(horn honking) Let's see what we got.
I'll take the driver.
So, I don't know how, but we have mostly minor injuries, some cuts and bruises, except for this guy, and I don't know if he's gonna make it.
Sergeant.
That truck came out of nowhere, man.
Piece of glass clipped him in the neck.
Feels like it hit a major artery.
EDDIE: Carotid. You got your finger in the hole?
That's what we're trained to do.
I've seen it before, unfortunately.
Me, too. Where were you?
Leatherneck.
Ah. I was at Bagram.
Army?
Uh-huh.
Nobody's perfect.
Let's run the fluids wide open.
You mind keeping your finger there for a moment?
You don't have anywhere to be, right?
Right.
I'm good.
Okay.
(helicopter blades whirring) EDDIE: On three. One, two, three.
All right.
All right, let's move him out of here, guys.
All right, keep the pressure.
All right, he's stabilizing.
Is he gonna make it?
Thanks to you, Marine.
How you feeling?
I'm fine.
Anything else I can do?
We're good.
Thank you for your service. Literally.
(sighs) You got it.
All right, we'll take him.
I hear you have a show to get to, Marine.
Yeah. But I'm never gonna make it.
Oh, yes, you are.
Let's go.
* (horn honking, siren wailing) Better hurry up and get dressed-- we're gonna be there before you know it.
I'm gonna cry. I-I know I'm gonna cry.
Those soldier reunion videos on YouTube always get me.
(horn honking) (microphone feedback) (gentle piano intro plays) HOPE: * I'll * Be home * For Christmas * Doo, doo, doo * * You * Can plan * On me * Please * Have snow * And mistletoe * And presents * On * The tree * Christmas * Eve * Will find me * Ooh, ooh, ooh * * Where * The love-light * Gleams * I'll * Be home * For Christmas (gasps) * If only * * In * * My dreams * (cheering) * I'll * * Be home * * For Christmas * * If only * Every time.

Hi.
Glad you came.
* Jack Frost nipping I wasn't sure.
* At your nose I thought I scared you off.
I really shouldn't have sprung that on you like that.
I just, uh, I wasn't thinking.
Well, you were feeling.
You were speaking from your heart, which is something that I love about you.
Which brings me to this. Merry Christmas.
* And some mistletoe Y-You don't want to wait till morning?
I don't want to wait another minute.
* Help to make the season bright * (laughs) (gasps softly) Bobby!
You offered me a key. So...
* Find it hard to sleep tonight * I don't want to take the next step.
I want to take every step, with you, for the rest of our lives. Marry me, Athena.
Bobby.
I know it might feel sudden and fast, but we both know how life works.
Yeah.
Life is fleeting and it's precious, and when you find happiness and you find somebody who fills your heart, gives you hope for the future and faith in yourself, you have...
Bobby! Yes!
Yes?
(softly): Yes.
You really said yes. It's a Christmas miracle.
Just put the damn ring on my finger.
* And so I'm offering...
Mm. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
* To kids from one * To 92 * Although * It's been said (alarm beeping) * Many times Dad!
* Many ways Dad? Wake up!
* Merry Christmas It's Christmas!
* To you * * And so I'm * Offering Mommy! Mommy!
* This simple phrase (Shannon squeals) Oh! Merry Christmas, baby.
* To kids from one * To 92 I missed you so much.
* Although it's been said I knew Santa could do it again.
* Many times, many ways (laughter) * Merry Christmas * To you.
Okay, we've got turkey, ham and six different sides.
Forget about the food.
What you have here is taste!
I mean, I mean, I know they call diamonds rocks, but this is a rock star.
I mean, is your hand tired?
'Cause I could help you carry that, for a while, if you need a little help.
BOBBY: It is a promise to Athena and her family for a lifetime of happiness, love and all the home-cooked meals you can eat.
Oh, that's sweet.
But let's not forget it's also a big damn diamond.
(laughter) (doorbell rings) You got that?
Yeah.
All right.
Merry Christmas.
Ah. Thanks for inviting me.
I brought Christmas, and... I brought congratulations.
Ah, thank you. Well, you are always welcome.
Maddie didn't want to join us?
I think this year she needed a different kind of Christmas.
All right, well, come on in.
All right. I'm excited.
(knocking) Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy.
Chinese food and Die Hard, the greatest Christmas movie ever made.
I'm sorry.
About the tree. I shouldn't...
Whoa-ho-ho.
Christmas is supposed to be about feeling safe and warm with the people you care about; that's the gift.
What it's wrapped in doesn't matter.
Who needs a tree?
* Round yon virgin Well...
I decided I do.
I didn't steal it. Someone left it on the sidewalk, and I didn't have a lot of time, so it's not perfect, but...
Well, who needs perfect?
It's, uh...
it's beautiful.
So what made you change your mind?
MADDIE: The holidays with Doug, they weren't a celebration.
It was a performance.
You know, pretending to be a... happy couple that had it all.
I just didn't want to pretend this year.
But then I realized that he's taken enough from me.
I'm not gonna let him take one more thing, and I sure as hell am not gonna let him take Christmas.
Last year was my worst Christmas ever.
But maybe also my best, because that's the day I decided to leave.
Now, that is a good reason to deck the halls.
* Silent * Night * Holy * Night (object shatters) * Son of God * Love's pure light * Radiant * Beams * From Thy * Holy face * With * The dawn (footsteps approaching) * Of redeeming * Grace Doug...
Shh.
I know you tried so hard.
It just wasn't right.
It wasn't perfect.
You'll get it right.
Someday you'll get it right.
(kisses)
