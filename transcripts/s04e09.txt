Honestly, I don't want to jinx it, but I sort of thought it would hurt more.
These contractions aren't even that painful.
Well, maybe you're just that much tougher than the average mama bear.

Oh, my goodness. Nia, you look so beautiful today.
What do we say, Nia?
Thank you. You're welcome.
Hello, everyone.
Sorry I'm late. Are we ready to see Mommy?
Are you ready for your visit? No. Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
It's okay, baby.
It'll just be a little while and we'll be here waiting for you when you're done.
I'm sorry.
But we should talk about scheduling some overnight visits for Nia and her mother.
Yes. We need to talk.
We want to meet her.
We want to meet Nia's birth mother.
Ms. Wilson, you know we can't do that.
Why not?
We need to make sure Nia's safe, right?
Mm-hmm.
That's the job you gave us...
Mm-hmm.
...as foster parents.
I-I want to do my job.
It's the state's job, and this is about reunification.
These last few visits were about rebuilding a bond and a trust between Nia and her biological mother.
Well, isn't there anything you can tell us about her?
Nothing beyond the fact that she's demonstrated her ability to give Nia a safe and stable home.
Demonstrate how?
We-we don't even know what she did wrong in the first place.
What-what, was it, was it drugs?
Was she abusive? Neglectful? What?
Look, it is not uncommon for foster parents to feel this way.
I mean, Nia has been with you a long time.
Longer than we expected.
And the pandemic made it longer.
What are our options?
For?
For protecting Nia.
Our legal options.
Can we adopt her?
Let me just stop you right here.
You've done a-an amazing job with Nia.
I wish I had a dozen more foster families like you.
But the reunification of a child and their birth parent is our main goal.
What if that birth parent is still unfit?
You have to trust us. We wouldn't have started this process if we thought her mother wasn't ready.
And even after she regains physical custody, we don't just walk away.
There'll be follow-up visits, check-ins.
We will make sure she's safe.
Come back inside when you're ready.
And Carly will bring Nia out after her visit.
And today, she goes home with you.
Hen? You need to calm down.
T-They're tearing our family apart, Karen.
H-How can I stay calm? How can you be calm?
Because this is the job.
It's what we signed up for.
We knew, we...
I didn't know it would, it would feel like this.
We were supposed to foster her for-for a few months.
It's been almost a year, Karen. She's our daughter now.
I know.
I know this is hard...
No, it's not hard.
It's wrong.
What the hell?
Oh! Oh, oh, my gosh.
Oh, I'm-I'm so sorry. I didn't, I didn't see you there.
I'd say we need a traffic light there, but I'm pretty sure you'd have barreled through that, too.
Hey. Are you okay?
Um, yeah. I guess.
I just got this friend request from someone I used to go to high school with.
Just kind of caught me by surprise.
Ah, a whole seven months ago.
How the time flies.
She transferred out a few years back.
After bullying me and making my life a living hell.
You want me to respond to her?
I'm sure I could think of a few choice ideas of where she can stick her friend request.
Hey, it-it's okay.
Just...I think I'm gonna ignore it.
You know, it's-it's been three years.
Doesn't really matter what she has to say anymore.
Attagirl.
You sure you should be working nights when you're that pregnant?
Oh, I figured staying up all night would be good practice for all the hours I'm gonna be keeping when the baby's born.
Well, you make me feel like I should be calling OSHA to report a labor violation.
Ooh. Don't say that word.
Whoa, are you having contractions?
Constantly.
But not real ones.
Braxton Hicks. I've been having them all week, and every time I think something's gonna happen...
nothing.
Ooh.
An emotional roller coaster.
Well, that would explain the nausea.
You guys got a name yet?
<i>Piper.</i> No. No.
Poppy.
Princess?
Yuck.
Priscilla.
Okay. That's it for the Ps.
Hey, should we s...What?
Now I have to pee.
That wasn't my fault!
Uh, still TBD.
Yeah, you might want to "D" that a little faster.
When my mother went to the hospital to have my little brother, she didn't have a name picked out, either.
Then she got all caught up in the emotion, named him after the nice doctor.
And my brother has been living his entire life regretting it.
Oh, my God. What did she name him?
Norman.
Isn't your last name...?
Bates.
Exactly.
Hey, anybody got any suggestions for baby names?
Not any of your names.
Uh, I thought you were just gonna put names in a hat.
Yeah.
Okay, here we go.
"I really don't want to pick our baby's name this way." Okay, but that's never gonna fit on her driver's license.
Maddie. Maddie!
Shannon and I didn't know what we were gonna name Christopher.
Then we saw him and we knew.
Right. We're way ahead of our skis here.
Uh, she didn't like that idea?
I think she just called me a psycho.
Maddie still having false labor?
I know kids are supposed to test your patience, but I thought she'd at least wait until she was out of the womb.
Well, at least, you'll be well-prepared for her arrival.
Oh, we are.
Baby toys, clothes, towels, blankets, supplements.
Freeze-dried rations.
Rations?
What, do you hate hospital food that much?
Hey, Wilson!
Could use a hand here.
No, in case the hospital loses power.
Ah.
Didn't we just restock the ambulance?
Well, yeah, but there's no such thing as being too prepared, right?
Sure. Like there's any rhyme or reason for the crap life throws at you.
The one and only. I'm Maddie.
What's your name?
Jacob.
Hi, Jacob. Are you okay?
My mom's acting weird.
Weird how?
I think she's lost. I asked her but she won't talk to me.
Where are you calling from, Jacob?
We're in the car.
Is your mom driving?
Yeah.
Can you put the phone on speaker so I can talk to your mom, Jacob?
Okay.
Mom, there's a 911 lady that wants to talk to you.
<i>Ma'am, this is 911.</i> <i>I understand</i> you're having some trouble.
<i>Please pull over</i> and we can send some help.
Mom, please.
Ma'am, can you hear me?
<i>She won't talk to anybody.</i> Mom, you got to talk to the lady.
Jacob, what's happening? M-My mom just hit another car!- Can you see where you are?
We're getting on the freeway.
But we're going the wrong way!
911. What's your emergency? <i>This car is driving</i> all over the road.
<i>-I swear she's blind.</i> 911. What's your emergency?
<i>I'm on the 710 and</i> <i>some idiot...</i> 911. What's your emergency?
<i>I've got my kids...</i> Can you see where you are?
<i>We're on the freeway.</i> 
 Dispatch to LAPD. We have a motorist driving against traffic in the northbound lanes of the 710 freeway.
Intercept immediately.
Ma'am, you need to pull over immediately.
CHP, this is Metro Dispatch.
You need to shut down the 710 north just after exit 43.
We have a female motorist driving south in the northbound lane.
Her son's with her in the car.
His name is Jacob.
CHP, please note, there is a child in the vehicle.
Mom! Please!
We're going the wrong way!
Can you hear me?
<i>Pull over! Now!</i> Mom! Please!
Mom! Please!
Please...
Jacob.
<i>Jacob, can you hear me?</i> <i>Jacob?</i> <i>All units responding</i> to incident on the 710.
<i>Dispatch, show 727-L-30</i> approaching crash site from the north side of the incident.
I'll report back after I rendezvous with the incident commander.
Copy that, 727.
All right, lift on three.
One, two, three.
Make sure everybody stays back until the cars have been de-energized and all the airbags have been checked.
What's the count, Captain?
Well, three casualties so far, at least a dozen injured.
Dispatch, send another ten R. A. units here ASAP.
Oh. All this because of one driver.
I take it this is the offending vehicle?
What's left of it. We're still working on getting in there.
You sure there's anyone in there left to save?
No verbal response. Can't see past the side airbags.
But we picked up a heat signature.
Definitely a live occupant in the front.
Smaller heat signature in the back.
Dispatch says they got a call from the driver's son, Jacob.
The kid's still in the car?
Go! Go! Jaws.
Check! One, two, three.
Buck, get in there.
I got a visual on the driver.
Come on!
No, no, no. The roof is bent too far inwards.
I-I can't pull her out.
Let's cut the whole top off.
Let's get the saw! Let's go!
Okay, nice and easy, on three.
One, two, three.
Need more hands!
I've got eyes on the boy.
He's still breathing.
All right, Buck, get that Halligan.
It's a miracle she's in one piece.
The car's hugging her like a glove.
Okay, Chim.
Okay. Young male victim. Possible vertebrae break.
Eddie, get me a neck brace.
Pulse is steady. Multiple lacerations.
Airbag burn.
What ha-happened?
You think her slurred speech is a symptom of her injuries?
Can't be too sure yet.
Dispatch says she was acting odd before the crash, too.
Chim, how's that kid looking?
Upper vertebra seems intact, but his systolic blood pressure is skyrocketing -- could be a TBI.
Probably best to transport him in the seat.
All right, make it safe and get him out.
Copy that. All right.
Dispatch, contact the Children's Hospital ER.
Have them prep for neurosurgery.
We've got a patient, Jacob, approximately seven to eight years old, coming in with a possible TBI.
Jacob?
Uh, Jacob is still in the back seat.
We're working on getting him out.
Ma'am, were you experiencing any pain, disorientation that may have led to your confusion?
I think I got something...that added to her confusion.
How many people have to die tonight because she was drunk and stupid?
Details to add to my report.
On three. One, two, three.
Got him?
Yeah.
He's not conscious but he's alive.
All right, let's move him.
Drunk driving with your only child in the car...
You good here, Hen?
Not one bit, Cap.
But I got it.
It's our job, right?
Yeah.
Please remain calm. We're gonna get you out...
Hey! Renfrow!
Did you disable the airbags?
It doesn't look like you did!
What's that, Cap?
Cap, you good?
Get Renfrow!
Renfrow.
The driver...
Did-did you get the driver?
We're working on it. Let's focus on you, Renfrow.
Gonna get you some air, okay?
I got him, I got him!
Buck, get him out of there.
That driver alive?
I'm checking his pulse.
He's got a pulse, but his skin is like paper.
I-I need a burn blanket.
Get the burn blanket!
Ready?
You got him?
Through the window, yeah.
You got his head?
Turn him.
Captain, we're moving Renfrow now.
Burn unit's been advised.
Good, good.
Hen! Eddie!
How are you guys doing up there?
<i>MAN</i> <i>We haven't moved in, like,</i> 35 minutes.
<i>-Was there an accident?</i> Yes, there was an accident on the freeway, and it seems...seems like you're stuck behind it.
<i>I'm type 1 diabetic, I've been</i> stuck in traffic forever <i>and my blood sugar's</i> getting super low -- feels like <i>-I might pass out in my car.</i> Okay, let me contact LAFD.
Maybe they can...
bring you a glucagon rescue kit.
What is the make and...plate of your vehicle?
<i>Black Ford F-150.</i> B93 F5.
Attention LAFD. There is a car...mile behind the pileup that needs glucagon.
Black F-150.
License plate...
Bravo-nine-tree-fr...
I'm sorry, Dispatch, <i>can you repeat</i> that plate number?
Yeah, just a second.
Hard to read you.
Bravo-9-3-Frank-5.
Black F-150 pickup. <i>-Copy that.</i> Sending an R. A. unit now.
Exactly how long have you been in labor?
Hard to tell. Weren't you a nurse?
I've got an hour left.
I got this.
I appreciate your dedication, but I'm gonna have to override you on this one.
Which hospital is she going to?
First Presbyterian on Altamont.
All right.
I'll follow behind. Make sure the hospital knows she's gonna need her BAC as soon as she lands.
Athena...
Already got the warrant, Eddie.
It'll meet me at the hospital.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm doing fine.
<i>SUE</i> <i>Captain Nash,</i> can you spare a paramedic for a woman in labor at Dispatch Metro?
Pretty sure there are some paramedics a lot closer to your location <i>-than we are.</i> Yes, but none of them are the baby's father.
We've got it from here, Chim. Go meet your daughter.
You sure?
I'm following that ambulance. You can ride with me.
Okay...that one was less than five minutes.
Yeah, you still think you got another hour in you?
Eh.
Okay, here are your things.
My car's downstairs and you are getting in it.
Okay, what about Chim?
Well, he's got a police escort.
He'll meet you there.
It just feels like it's going so fast.
You're nine and a half months pregnant.
It's not that fast.
Oh...!
Oh, God.
Okay, wish me luck.
Good luck.
Word of advice? If she tells you to shut up, shut up.
Copy that.
No, no, no, no. I-I don't understand.
What do you mean I can't see her?
She's here, right?
Yes, your wife is here, but as I explained already, her room is currently listed as secured.
Secured?
What does that even mean?
Everything okay here?
Uh, this gentleman is here to see Rachel Hawkerson.
She's my wife. I got a call that she and my son were in some kind of accident, but nobody will tell me anything, except that my son is at a different hospital and I can't see my wife.
Sir, they were part of the collision on the 710 freeway.
The-the big pileup?
Yes.
Can we go somewhere quiet where we can talk?
I want to see my wife.
I'm afraid you can't do that right now.
Your wife's room is secure because she's in our custody while we investigate the cause of tonight's accident.
The cau...
Right.
On the news, they said it was a drunk driver.
Yes.
No.
No.
She wouldn't do that.
Not with Jacob in the car.
She promised me.
Sometimes, we break our promises.
Okay.
Yes. Uh, thank you.
How's your son?
He's still in surgery.
I, uh...
I need to get over there.
I can have an officer take you.
Did she say anything?
Rachel? At the scene?
She wasn't really coherent.
You didn't know she was drinking?
I thought all this was behind us.
She tried so many times to stay sober.
It almost broke our marriage.
But then...
then Jacob.
And I thought...
I thought, "Finally, she'll have a reason not to drink." I don't know what I'm gonna tell him.
Is there...Is there any way you're wrong about this?
She had a BAC of .28 when she arrived.
Four times the legal limit.
Probably higher at the time of the crash.
That would account for her disorientation from your son's 911 call.
Jacob's the one who called 911?
My poor boy.
You didn't know.
I should have.
I'm here! I'm here. I didn't miss it, did I? Any longer, you might have.
You're fully effaced and at ten centimeters.
We're ready to rock. We're gonna grab a few things, and we'll get started.
Are you okay? Can I do anything for you?
I can shut up. I mean, I can try.
No, no, you're fine.
You know what I need is my breathing beads.
They're in the baby bag. Where is that?
They're not here. I left them in Albert's car.
Ugh!
You know what?
I can call him real fast. Maybe he can run it back over here. Come on, come on, come on.
<i>Hello. This is Albert Han.</i> <i>Please do not leave a message.</i> That's what texts are for.

He's probably sleeping. I'm so sorry.

CHIMNEY You're okay.

Well, luckily, we don't have to.
Go get some rest.
Thanks, Sue. Good night. Morning. Whatever.
Hey, Buck. It's good to see you.
The hospital has a strict no visitor policy right now.

The girls are both doing great.
Maddie was a warrior in there.
Oh, hey, where'd you get that?
Is Albert here?
Oh, hey. Good morning.
The kids are still brushing their teeth, but pancakes should be done in five.
You packed her bag?
Yeah. Overnight visit, remember?
Social worker will be by this afternoon.
No, no, not tonight.
Ton -- I need to sleep tonight and-and know that she's safe.
Hen......we can't stop this.
How could you just stand there?
What?
Nia. Nia's...
damn near crying her eyes out, and you just write it off like it happens every day.
And the social worker tells us there's nothing we could do, and you just stand there.
Why don't you want to fight this, Karen?
You think I don't want to?
It doesn't seem like it.
It seems like you've already accepted it.
Y-You're making pancakes, you're packing bags.
Wh-What are you doing?
Don't you dare.
Tell me why you don't want to fight this!
Because there is no fight.

I'm holding on.
That is all I am doing, holding on.
Please don't make me do it alone.
Come on.
Hey! Guess who's here!
Mama Hen!
I mean, I've been at a lot of deliveries before, but...this one really did seem kind of miraculous.
I guess all dads feel that way.
I am a dad.
How crazy is that?
I can't wait for you to meet her.
Still doesn't have a name though.
I don't suppose you have any suggestions?
Yeah, I'm kind of stumped, too.
What about Alberta?
Or...Albertina?
I thought for sure I'd get a response on that one.
Listen...
I know you're tired and you've had a really crappy day, but...I kind of need you to wake up here and tell me you're okay, 'cause your doctors are giving me some real serious looks and expressing their concerns.
But they don't know us Hans.
We are excellent healers.
So you're gonna be all right, 'cause you're my brother.
And I don't know when that went from being a biological fact to an emotional reality for me, but...
there's no turning back now.
You know, I finally have everything I ever wanted.
A family of my own.
Maddie.
The baby.
And you.
Yep. Today could be the best day of my life.
'Cause I have my beautiful baby girl...and my brother didn't die.
In fact, he woke up and he told me he was gonna be okay.
So you just open your eyes, Albert.
Please.
It hurts.
It's okay.
Hey.
We got plenty of time, little brother.
Heard about Albert.
Is he okay?
He's alive.
What about that boy from the crash? Jacob?
Surgery was a success.
He's stable and recovering with his father.
That's good.
Mother got lucky.
Minor scrapes and bruises.
Husband says he had no idea that she had started drinking again.
Not sure if I believe him.
Well, could be true.
Could be he just needed to believe it was true.
I'm sorry about what I said at the wreck.
"Drunk and stupid" thing.
You weren't wrong.
People died last night because of her.
I don't know her, but I know what it's like to inflict that kind of damage.
Bobby, you are nothing like that woman.
I am exactly like that woman.
The day I forget that, that will be a very dangerous day.
I got to go out for a while.
I love you.

And, yeah, last night was a hard night.
But I'm here.
And I didn't have a drink.
So maybe today can be a good day.
And if today can be a good day, maybe tomorrow can be, too.

<i>Soon.</i> <i>Dr. Heller just wants us</i> to wait a few more weeks.

<i>-Man.</i> I can't believe Chimney just missed the first "Uncle Buck." <i>It's, uh...it's okay.</i> Knowing him, <i>-I'm sure we're in</i> or about 10,000 more of those. f Okay. I am clean and ready to hold my girl.
Uncle Buck!
Was I the first one? I was the first one, right?

Yeah. <i>-'Kay, I'll, uh,</i> leave you guys to it.

What was that about?
Hello, Baby Girl Han.
You were right. We should have picked a name sooner.
I can't believe they discharged you without something for the birth certificate.
I picked a name.
I'm sorry. Don't be mad. I had to give them something.
I'm not sure if I'm mad or relieved.
Pressure's off.
It's not something I'm gonna hate, is it?
It's Jee-Yun.
That's my mother's name.
I called Mrs. Lee to tell her about the baby and Albert.
And she just kept saying, "I wish his mother was here to see her." And that's when I knew what her name was.
Jee-Yun Buckley Han.
It's pretty good, right?
It's beautiful.
I'm really glad that Albert's okay.
Yeah, me, too.
God, talk about bad luck.
No.
I'm starting to think we're just the luckiest people ever.
Yeah.
Hi, Jee-Yun. Hi.
