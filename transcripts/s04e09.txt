<strong>Carly</strong>: Oh, my goodness. Nia, you look so beautiful today.
<strong>Karen</strong>: What do we say, Nia?
Thank you.
<strong>Carly</strong>: You're welcome.
(<em>door opens</em>)
<strong>Deidra</strong>: Hello, everyone.
Sorry I'm late. Are we ready to see Mommy?
<strong>Carly</strong>: Are you ready for your visit?
<strong>Nia</strong>: No. Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
<strong>Karen</strong>: It's okay, baby.
It'll just be a little while and we'll be here waiting for you when you're done.
(<em>crying</em>)
<strong>Deidra</strong>: I'm sorry.
But we should talk about scheduling some overnight visits for Nia and her mother.
<strong>Hen</strong>: Yes. We need to talk.
We want to meet her.
We want to meet Nia's birth mother.
Ms. Wilson, you know we can't do that.
Why not?
We need to make sure Nia's safe, right?
Mm-hmm.
That's the job you gave us...
Mm-hmm.
...as foster parents.
I-I want to do my job.
It's the state's job, and this is about reunification.
These last few visits were about rebuilding a bond and a trust between Nia and her biological mother.
Well, isn't there anything you can tell us about her?
Nothing beyond the fact that she's demonstrated her ability to give Nia a safe and stable home.
Demonstrate how?
We-we don't even know what she did wrong in the first place.
What-what, was it, was it drugs?
Was she abusive? Neglectful? What?
Look, it is not uncommon for foster parents to feel this way.
I mean, Nia has been with you a long time.
Longer than we expected.
And the pandemic made it longer.
What are our options?
For?
For protecting Nia.
<strong>Hen</strong>: Our legal options.
Can we adopt her?
<strong>Deidra</strong>: Let me just stop you right here.
You've done a-an amazing job with Nia.
I wish I had a dozen more foster families like you.
But the reunification of a child and their birth parent is our main goal.
What if that birth parent is still unfit?
<strong>Deidra</strong>: You have to trust us. We wouldn't have started this process if we thought her mother wasn't ready.
And even after she regains physical custody, we don't just walk away.
There'll be follow-up visits, check-ins.
We will make sure she's safe.
Come back inside when you're ready.
And Carly will bring Nia out after her visit.
And today, she goes home with you.
Hen? You need to calm down.
T-They're tearing our family apart, Karen.
H-How can I stay calm? How can you be calm?
Because this is the job.
It's what we signed up for.
We knew, we...
I didn't know it would, it would feel like this.
We were supposed to foster her for-for a few months.
It's been almost a year, Karen. She's our daughter now.
I know.
I know this is hard...
No, it's not hard.
It's wrong.

I'd say we need a traffic light there, but I'm pretty sure you'd have barreled through that, too.
Hey. Are you okay?
<strong>May</strong>: Um, yeah. I guess.
I just got this friend request from someone I used to go to high school with.
Just kind of caught me by surprise.
<strong>Josh</strong>: Ah, a whole seven months ago.
How the time flies.
<strong>May</strong>: She transferred out a few years back.
After bullying me and making my life a living hell.
<strong>Josh</strong>: You want me to respond to her?
I'm sure I could think of a few choice ideas of where she can stick her friend request.
Hey, it-it's okay.
Just... I think I'm gonna ignore it.
You know, it's-it's been three years.
Doesn't really matter what she has to say anymore.
Attagirl.
<strong>Linda</strong>: You sure you should be working nights when you're that pregnant?
Oh, I figured staying up all night would be good practice for all the hours I'm gonna be keeping when the baby's born.
Well, you make me feel like I should be calling OSHA to report a labor violation.
(<em>strains</em>): Ooh. Don't say that word.
Whoa, are you having contractions?
Constantly.
But not real ones.
Braxton Hicks. I've been having them all week, and every time I think something's gonna happen... nothing.
Ooh.

Hey, should we s... What?
Now I have to pee.
That wasn't my fault!
Uh, still TBD.
<strong>Linda</strong>: Yeah, you might want to &quot;D&quot; that a little faster.
When my mother went to the hospital to have my little brother, she didn't have a name picked out, either.
Then she got all caught up in the emotion, named him after the nice doctor.
And my brother has been living his entire life regretting it.
Oh, my God. What did she name him?
Norman.
Isn't your last name...?
Bates.
Exactly.
(<em>sighs</em>) Hey, anybody got any suggestions for baby names?
Not any of your names.
Uh, I thought you were just gonna put names in a hat.
Yeah.
Okay, here we go.
&quot;I really don't want to pick our baby's name this way.&quot;
Okay, but that's never gonna fit on her driver's license.
Maddie. Maddie!
Shannon and I didn't know what we were gonna name Christopher.
Then we saw him and we knew.

No, in case the hospital loses power.

Is there... Is there any way you're wrong about this?
She had a BAC of .28 when she arrived.

<strong>Chimney</strong>: The girls are both doing great.
Maddie was a warrior in there.
Oh, hey, where'd you get that?
Is Albert here?
Oh, hey. Good morning.
The kids are still brushing their teeth, but pancakes should be done in five.
<strong>Hen</strong>: You packed her bag?
Yeah. Overnight visit, remember?
Social worker will be by this afternoon.
No, no, not tonight.
Ton... I need to sleep tonight and-and know that she's safe.
Hen... (<em>exhales</em>) ...we can't stop this.
How could you just stand there?
What?
Nia. Nia's... damn near crying her eyes out, and you just write it off like it happens every day.
And the social worker tells us there's nothing we could do, and you just stand there.
Why don't you want to fight this, Karen?
You think I don't want to?
It doesn't seem like it.
It seems like you've already accepted it.
Y-You're making pancakes, you're packing bags.
Wh-What are you doing?
Don't you dare.
Tell me why you don't want to fight this!
Because there is no fight.
She has a mother.
She's not ours, even if we love her like she is.
You want to know what I'm doing?
I'm holding on.
That is all I am doing, holding on.
Please don't make me do it alone.

...this one really did seem kind of miraculous.

I guess all dads feel that way.
I am a dad. (<em>Chuckles</em>)
How crazy is that?
I can't wait for you to meet her.
Still doesn't have a name though.
I don't suppose you have any suggestions?
Yeah, I'm kind of stumped, too.
What about Alberta?
Or... Albertina?
I thought for sure I'd get a response on that one.
Listen...
(<em>inhales shakily</em>)
I know you're tired and you've had a really crappy day, but... (<em>exhales</em>) .. I kind of need you to wake up here and tell me you're okay, 'cause your doctors are giving me some real serious looks and expressing their concerns.
But they don't know us Hans.
(<em>sniffles</em>)
We are excellent healers.
So you're gonna be all right, 'cause you're my brother.
(<em>exhales</em>)
And I don't know when that went from being a biological fact to an emotional reality for me, but... there's no turning back now.
You know, I finally have everything I ever wanted.
A family of my own.
Maddie.
The baby.
And you.
Yep. Today could be the best day of my life.
'Cause I have my beautiful baby girl...
(<em>shudders</em>)
.. and my brother didn't die. (<em>chuckles</em>)
In fact, he woke up and he told me he was gonna be okay.
(<em>shuddering</em>)
So you just open your eyes, Albert.

Please.

Is he okay?
He's alive.
What about that boy from the crash? Jacob?
Surgery was a success.
He's stable and recovering with his father.
That's good.
Mother got lucky.
Minor scrapes and bruises.
Husband says he had no idea that she had started drinking again.
Not sure if I believe him.
Well, could be true.
Could be he just needed to believe it was true.

I'm sorry about what I said at the wreck.

Bobby, you are nothing like that woman.
I am exactly like that woman.

Hello, Baby Girl Han.
You were right. We should have picked a name sooner.
I can't believe they discharged you without something for the birth certificate.
I picked a name.
I'm sorry. Don't be mad. I had to give them something.
I'm not sure if I'm mad or relieved.
Pressure's off.
It's not something I'm gonna hate, is it?
(<em>chuckles softly</em>)
It's Jee-Yun.
That's my mother's name.
I called Mrs. Lee to tell her about the baby and Albert.
And she just kept saying, &quot;I wish his mother was here to see her.&quot;
(<em>chuckles softly</em>)
And that's when I knew what her name was.

Jee-Yun Buckley Han.
It's pretty good, right?
It's beautiful.

I'm really glad that Albert's okay.

God, talk about bad luck.

No.
I'm starting to think we're just the luckiest people ever.
(<em>chuckles softly</em>)
Yeah.
Hi, Jee-Yun. Hi.
