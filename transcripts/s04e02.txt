Just remember what I said. You're the lifeline.

<strong>Athena</strong>: What's this?
We wanted to celebrate your first day back at work.
Oh, what a nice surprise.
Turns out, you were the one with the real surprise.
You know, so much for desk duty.
I almost had a desk fall on my head.

<strong>Athena</strong>: How are you doing?
We both had a hell of a day.
Yeah, it was crazy.
I thought I knew what expect, but...
It takes its toll.
I wish I could say it gets easier, but it doesn't.
You know, no one would fault you if you decided to walk away.
Especially after the day you had.
You think I'm going to quit?
That I can't hack it?
I know you're capable.
I just hoped you come to your senses.
I know you don't understand why.
You're right. I don't.
You were looking forward to USC.
You were gonna major in prelaw, maybe journalism.
You had plans.
Then all of a sudden...
You got hurt.
Plans changed.
(<em>sentimental music</em>)
I took the job because of you.
What?
This last year.
Dad's brain tumor, you almost dying.
Then everything else in the world?
I couldn't control any of it.
And the thought of you going back out there on the streets?
May.
I've been a cop for 30 years.
I know how to do this job.
You do not have to worry about me.
But I do.
You take crazy risks with your life.
I'm a police officer. It comes with the territory.
And that's why I took this job.
So when you go out there, you'll never have to be alone again.
