<i> BENNY:</i> <i> Southern California,</i> <i>home to some of North America's</i> <i> most beautiful landscapes</i> <i> and an astounding</i> <i> variety of wildlife.</i> Witness the Homo sapien.
The most intelligent of the order of primates.
A fascinating species.
With a highly sophisticated intelligence and endless curiosity about the natural world.
Ah...
The female Southern California Ornithologist.
Beautiful. Majestic.
Just the kind of bird watcher you could bring home to meet your parents.
Clearly being pursued by a lesser, hopeful mate.
(on phone): ♪<i> I feel sexilicious, sexi.</i> ♪ What's up?
Just start without me.
Knowing Carol, it's probably a carrot cake anyway.
GILBERT: Hey, check this out.
Tons of Lumbricus terrestris under here.
Ooh. <i> BENNY: Hey, I got to go.</i> Because I'm busy, okay? I... I got to go. Bye.
Where were we, my love?
Oh, no.
What the hell are they doing?
Hey!
That's not a safe place to be.
Hey, hey!
What?
You got to get out of there!
That's not a safe place to be!
Aah!
Aah!
Dispatch said a tree fell on a victim?
Yeah, but probably not how you're imagining.
He was standing underneath the root ball of a fallen tree when it snapped back up on top of him.
That's a thing that happens?
BENNY: Well, sometimes after storms or if other debris pinning the downed tree falls away, the tension from the root system still underground can pull it back up.
Like a mighty oak slingshot.
Yeah, one that weighs several tons.
(muffled moaning) Hurry! I can hear him moaning under there!
Okay, all right. That's good.
That means he's still alive. Let me have you clear out.
Make some room for my team to work.
All right.
Eddie, Chimney, start digging access holes on the side.
BOTH: Copy that.
All right. Dispatch, this is Captain 118.
We've got a victim with multiple crush wounds.
We're gonna need a air ambulance at the nearest clearing to our GPS coordinates.
<i> DISPATCHER:</i> <i> Copy that, Captain 118.</i> HEN: I need a chain saw to separate the tree from these roots.
<i> DISPATCHER:</i> <i> 118, Medevac Three is eight</i> <i>minutes out from your location.</i> Buck, on me.
I need a anchor point and a hinge so we can expose that root ball.
BUCK: Anchor point secure.
EDDIE: I see the head.
(grunts) And I got a foot.
Okay, pulleys are secure.
Okay.
Shouldn't take much to pull it down now.
I got a pedal pulse. It's weak, but it's there.
EDDIE: Airway is patent.
Breath is severely diminished by the pressure of the tree.
All right, Chim, run a peripheral line of saline through his ankle.
His body's gonna want to decompensate when we remove the pressure from the tree.
All right.
EDDIE: Let me have that turnout.
I'll use it to protect his airway.
Here's the chain saw, Cap.
CHIMNEY: I'm in, Cap.
All right, everyone in position to pull.
Give me those jumbos.
HEN: Once I cut the roots on this side, we can tip the tree over.
All right.
All right, on my mark.
One, two...
Three!
(grunting) BUCK: Come on!
(grunting) EDDIE: Almost there.
Buck, clear out!
Timber.
EDDIE: He's not breathing.
CHIMNEY: Pulse is bottoming out. Looks like massive internal bleeding. Let's get him on a board.
On three. One, two, three.
Starting compressions.
Eddie, get him on a Lifepak. Bag him.
Please, you've got to save my brother.
Your brother?
Yeah, he and I have been bird watching since we were kids.
EDDIE: All right, preparing to shock.
Clear.
No conversion. I'm going again.
Clear.
Normal rhythm. We got a pulse.
Oh, thank God.
Keep bagging him while we prepare for transport.
CHIMNEY: On three. One, two, three.
Up.
Uh, if there's not enough room for you to fly in the helicopter with him, I'd be happy to drive you to the hospital to meet him.
Pretty sure there's enough room on the helo for you to ride with your brother.
BENNY: Uh, well, then...
maybe you want to take my number?
Uh, it can be dangerous out here alone for a female Southern California ornithologist.
Are you seriously asking me out after my brother almost died?
BENNY: I thought when she said it was her brother that maybe that was my shot.
Well... (grunts softly) I think maybe you have bad instincts.
Better luck next time.
<i> MADDIE: So, you just</i> <i> say yes to everything?</i> <i> BUCK: Yeah, he calls it</i> radical acceptance.
What does that mean?
Yeah, well, so his theory is that we've all become too comfortable in our lives, right? We...
we go to the same jobs every day.
We hang out with the same groups of people.
We eat at the same restaurants, we shop at the same stores.
We don't do anything that makes us feel uncomfortable or-or that just scares us.
What about running into burning buildings?
No, it doesn't count. That's just work, you know?
Uh, before I came to L. A., I had all these adventures.
You know? I-I went new places, I tried new things, I met new people.
That's 'cause you were searching for something.
What are you looking for now?
That's what I'm gonna find out.
By opening myself up to possibility.
Okay. What about this?
You quit your job, become my nanny and then I can stop looking at these résumés.
That-that's gonna be a hard no.
No.<i> The Age of Absolutely</i> isn't about dramatic life changes, and becoming your new nanny would feel like a dramatic life change.
Well, so does hiring one. They're all either 12 or a potential serial killer.
Come on, don't limit them-- they could be both.
Uh, listen, I-I got to go.
Uh, I'm meeting my old roommate Connor and his new wife for dinner tonight.
Whoa, frat boy Connor?
That guy got married?
Yeah, like, two years ago.
Uh, we-we kind of lost touch, but...
reached out recently, invited me to dinner, and I said...
Absolutely?
There you go.
(chuckles) Good luck.
<i> CHRISTOPHER: This...</i> is the wrong kind of mayo.
It was on sale.
You know, Dad, sometimes you get what you pay for.
Great. I'm raising a condiment snob.
(groans) And an impulse shopper.
What is this?
Cereal.
Not sure a nutritionist would agree.
I got us the healthy one, too.
Balanced.
(chuckles softly) Lucky you're cute.
(phone vibrates) Oh, it's your school.
Wait, Dad, we didn't finish the groceries.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mr. Diaz.
Really?
I had no idea.
And how long has Christopher been skipping Science Club?
<i> HEN: I called maintenance.</i> They're gonna try to come by tomorrow.
Great.
Okay. Have a good shift.
Thanks.
BOBBY: You got a minute, Cap?
(sighs) Don't call me that.
Come on, just this once? (chuckles) No.
Since you're here, that must mean that Samuel's doing better?
Yes, he is.
He's finally getting settled back at home and Athena's finding somebody to come by, take care of her parents after she leaves.
When's that gonna be?
Probably end of next week.
How are you doing?
Good.
I uploaded everything to FireStat this morning, the duty rosters are...
I Wasn't asking about work.
I already know you did a great job.
Who called you? Chim?
Karen.
(exhales) How much did she yell?
No, she kept a perfectly respectable tone the entire time she called me an idiot.
I am sorry, Hen.
I shouldn't have put this on you.
I volunteered.
It's not your fault I flunked out of medical school.
Well, maybe I can call them, tell them what happened, and you could retake the test.
Thanks, Bobby.
I appreciate the gesture, but I don't think there's anything either of us can do.
Okay, well, maybe I can't fix the things at medical school, but I can do something-- give you a little time off.
You've been pushing too hard for too long, you're exhausted and you need a break.
So take as many days or weeks as you need to get recharged.
(exhales) That's an order.
Time off?
Not sure I even know what to do with that.
Try doing nothing.
And if anyone asks you to do anything, just say no.
(chuckling): So... is that when you moved into the frat house?
Hold on.
It wasn't a total frat house. Okay? We had real jobs.
Five guys under one roof?
That's a frat house.
We weren't that bad. Or... were we?
There-there was this one time when...
Well, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
We were smart enough not to bring women back to that place.
It wasn't really conducive to romantic evenings.
Oh. Well, good.
'Cause, before me, I'd like to think there were no romantic evenings.
Really? Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Uh, listen, I don't-I don't even know-- how-how did you guys meet?
The old-fashioned way.
At a bar.
He was picking up takeout and I was sitting at the bar eating, alone.
Not just eating alone but reading a book.
I was intrigued, so I sat next to her and ate my takeout right there.
And I thought he was some sort of weird stalker.
'Cause, I mean, who talks to strangers anymore?
Right, right. (chuckles) And who reads actual books?
Anyway, I charmed her with my corny jokes, He did.
and...
that was it.
That was it.
Wow, and-and your frat house days are finally behind you.
Yeah.
We actually bought a house last year.
We did.
You guys are really doing it all, huh?
Marriage, house, and... and kids?
Kind of.
We've sort of hit a snag on that last part.
It's crazy. When I was single, all I did was pray not to be pregnant, and now...
Nothing seems to get the job done.
Uh, I'm sorry to hear that.
You know, I-I think more people struggle with fertility issues than-than we realize.
But there's lots options now, right?
There's-there's drugs, IVF, even surrogacy.
Kameron's not the problem.
I am.
Not enough swimmers.
Uh, um...
Huh, I'm-I'm sorry to hear that.
Uh, th... um, that must be tough.
You have no idea.
But we're looking at other options.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, specifically, sperm donor options.
Nice.
Which is why we actually invited you to dinner.
(chuckles) We wanted to know if you'd consider being our sperm donor.
He's been lying right to my face.
Has he never lied to you before?
I mean, little things.
Like, did he brush his teeth before he went to bed or did he put the empty milk carton back into the fridge.
But not like this.
Well, in his defense, Science Club does sound kind of boring.
Joining was his idea.
Probably knew it would make a great cover. Smart kid.
HEN: So, wait, if he wasn't going to Science Club, then where was he?
At the park with his friends, apparently.
Which I really don't understand, because he knows that I'd take him there anytime he wants.
Maybe that's the problem.
No offense, but Christopher might be getting to that age where he doesn't want Dad around all the time.
Yeah, kids do grow to crave privacy.
Half the thrill sometimes is doing something and thinking you're getting away with it.
He should've told me that before he got caught lying, got grounded for one week.
No video games, no exemptions.
Tough but fair.
Notice you're being awfully quiet over there, Buck.
Christopher hasn't said anything to you about these little secrets, has he?
Uh, to me? No, no-no secrets here.
Buck probably can't relate because he always tells us the truth about his life, often in excruciatingly specific detail.
Mm.
Hen, you're supposed to be on leave.
What are you doing here?
I, uh... uh, swung by to, uh, pick up some kombucha that I left in the fridge.
Really? Where is it?
I couldn't find it.
Hmm.
I guess somebody drank it.
Hmm.
My house is too damn quiet, Cap.
Karen's off at work, Denny's with his friends.
I have no tests to study for and the silence is kind of deafening.
I-I-I just needed to come somewhere with a little bit more noise.
(alarm ringing) (indistinct announcement over P. A.) BOBBY: Hen, I say this with love.
Don't be here when we get back.
(engine starts) (indistinct chatter) Dispatch, 118 is on the scene, Eighth and Alameda.
Five cars and one bike.
All right. How you feeling sir?
(groaning) I'm just... happy I wore a helmet.
Feels like you have a broken fibula.
SCOTTY: Yeah. (grunting) My left leg took the brunt of the hit, but...
I was able to ride out of it, so...
(exhaling sharply) Must be a some kind of bike.
What happened?
I was just cruising on my steel frame, and that idiot over there swerved into the bike lane.
He hit me and then veered into that oncoming car.
He was driving like a crazy person!
Or a drunk one.
Smells like a distillery in here.
Chim, you need a coroner?
Nope, he's still alive. Pulse is strong with this one.
(grunting) The other side...
LAFD. Can you hear me?
Sir, can you hear me?
No response to sternal rub.
I'm gonna take his vitals.
We need to cut him out and transport him, ASAP.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Do not do that. (shouts) Oh, my God.
(horn honking) Where the hell is he going?
Wait a sec, is Chim still in the car?
Dispatch, be advised we have a possible drunk driver who just drove off with one of our paramedics in a silver Prius.

<i> (chuckling)</i> I finally got Christopher to actually go to his Science Club meeting today, but 20 minutes in, I get a call from his teacher saying he's refusing to participate.
She said it was an extracurricular club, so if he doesn't want to be there, I should just take him home. <i> That doesn't sound</i> <i> like Christopher.</i> Yeah.
I tried to talk about it with him and...
he ignored me the whole drive back. <i> That part--</i> <i> that part sounds like us.</i> <i> The old Diaz family</i> <i> cold shoulder.</i> <i> Your Abuela originated it,</i> <i> but as I recall,</i> <i> you perfected it.</i> Ha, ha, very funny.
<i> (chuckles)</i> Everyone keeps on telling me this is normal and that I should give him some room to grow, but...
I can't help it if it's my instinct to always want to protect him.
You know, the world is tough. And he's not.

Uh...
Hey.
Hey, man.
Do you have a minute?
Look, I just wanted to come by and apologize for the other night.
We pretty much blindsided you, and I really feel terrible about that.
Uh, yeah, you did catch me off guard.
I know.
I haven't seen you in three years and the first time we reconnect, I asked for body fluids.
(chuckles softly) That wasn't the right way to ask you.
Is there is a... a right way to ask that question?
(clicks tongue) Probably not.
Mm.
(laughs) Come on. Take a seat. (exhales) Uh, so, hey, are you-are you doing okay?
(Connor clears throat) Do you know what it feels like to feel like a total failure as a man, and like you're letting down the woman you love?
Uh, probably not in the same way you feel right now.
I assumed it was her.
You know, we were trying for months, changing her diet, ovulation thermometers, the whole bit.
Never occurred to me that I couldn't do this for her.
For us.
Yeah, I-I got to ask you.
Why me?
I mean, you could go to a sperm bank, you could-you could pick someone with perfect genes.
Yeah.
We could flip through a book and know stuff like their eye color, whether they're gonna be a scientist or an artist or what their body type is.
But we couldn't know if they'd be a good person.
How they treat the people they care about.
I know those things about you.
That's way more important than the superficial stuff.
I...
(chuckles softly) I swear, this isn't me trying to convince you.
No, it's, uh...
it's nice to hear.
Thank you for saying that.
Thank you for hearing me out.
I know this is asking too much.
I'm letting you off the hook here.
You do not need to do this.
<i> CLARIBELLE:</i> <i> The SeeWahPah</i> <i> laughed an evil laugh.</i> (cackles) She creeps to the tent the boy was hiding in.
Then...
Uh...
The brave woodsman.
The brave woodsman and his spotted dog with five toes on his paws ran to the woods.
And the five-toed dog barks.
(barks) (howls) Then, the SeeWahPah runs through the woods on its backward feet, and was never heard from again.
Very good,<i> mija.</i> Very good.

Uh-huh?
Are Ciguapas real?

<i> Claribelle.</i> <i> 215 Greencrest Street.</i> Hi, Claribelle. I'm Maddie.
I'm sending help to you right away.
Are you home alone?
No. My mom's here, too.
She sent me to call you.
<i> She always said that</i> <i> if my Dad came,</i> <i> I should call 911 right away.</i> Claribelle, can you give me your address again?
215 Greencrest Street.
Are you sure? <i> I-I...</i> I don't know.
(thuds) LOURDES: Get out of my house!
Please, Maddie, help us! He's inside!
It's okay, honey, just hold on for me.
Everything okay?
(sighs) I have a domestic battery in progress, but I can't locate them.
Cell phone towers say Lincoln Park, but the address she gave me is showing up as invalid.
What is it?
215 Greencrest.
He already broke down the front door.
They don't have a lot of time.
If there's that much commotion going on, maybe someone heard it.
Another 911 call?
Hang on. I'll go check.
Claribelle, you still with me?
(pounding) Yes, I'm here. Are you sending help?
Soon, sweetheart. Where are you in the house?
In my room.
Is there any place you can hide until help gets there?
<i> Uh, my closet?</i> Good, go in there.
(Lourdes screams) (Stephen grunting) 215 Glencrest.
Police and RA are already en route.
No, wait, if he hears them coming, uh, he could make her a hostage. Radio them again with an update and tell them to run cold.
On it.
Claribelle, help is almost there.
(loud clattering) (glass shatters) <i> (panting)</i> I don't hear her anymore.
<i> Do you think she's dead?</i> (sighs) I don't know.
He always told my Mom that she doesn't belong in this country.
<i> And that he could take me away</i> <i> from her if he wants to,</i> <i> and she'll never see me again.</i> That's why we ran.
STEPHEN: Claribelle?
<i> Claribelle.</i> Baby?
He's looking for me.
<i> Where are the police?</i> They'll be there soon.
But he's probably gonna find you first.
<i> STEPHEN: Claribelle!</i> <i>-CLARIBELLE: He's gonna take me.</i> I don't want to go. <i> Hey, listen to me.</i> You have to go with him. <i> STEPHEN: Claribelle.</i> I know it's scary, but it's the safest thing for you to do right now. <i> Claribelle?</i> <i> Claribelle? Baby.</i> Let him take you.
Please don't make me, Maddie.
I promise it's gonna be okay.
(door bangs open) STEPHEN: Claribelle, baby, where are you?
He's here.
Don't let him see you have a phone.
STEPHEN: There you are.
Why would you lock the door like that <i> on me, sweetheart?</i> <i> CLARIBELLE: Where's Mom?</i> Mommy's resting.
We have to go, now.
I'm not leaving Mom.

Sorry, I-I know you're-you're supposed to be relaxing. I...
No, no, no, no.
I have never been happier to see someone show up unannounced at my house, ever. Please.
Uh, guessing the relaxing is-is not going so well.
(scoffs) Doing nothing is giving me more anxiety than trying to do everything.
I'm not wired for this.
What's happening?
What do you know about sperm donors?
HEN: And you didn't say no?
Mm. I didn't feel like I could.
Right. Your "age of absolutely" thing.
No, no, no. Not even just 'cause of that.
I didn't want to turn them down. I felt bad for them.
Which is very kind of you.
I mean, me and Karen have been where they are.
When you're trying and you want it, and it's just not happening, it's devastating.
If you said yes, you'd be changing their lives.
Right, which is-is, uh, a pro.
You know, a-a big pro.
If I can help ease this burden for them, why would I not do that?
'Cause you'd be also changing your life.
Yeah, come on, for, like... a few minutes?
Ew. Stop.
(chuckling) But, seriously, for the rest of your life.
This isn't an anonymous donation, Buck.
You won't have to wonder whether there's a kid out there with your DNA.
You're gonna know there is.
You'll probably get Christmas cards.
(exhales) The main thing to ask yourself...
is are you capable of doing this?
I think we both know I'm...
I'm-I'm capable, uh, that's why they asked me.
Are you capable of being a father and walking away?
Because that's what they're really asking you.
Donor, not dad.
Exactly.
You'd be changing their lives, but they're not necessarily inviting you to stick around and be a part of it.
Right.
Yeah.
I guess-I guess I never really thought about that part.
You need to.
Huh.
Hey Maddie. How's your day going?
Yesterday was a wild ride.
Yeah.
It was. Thanks for your help with that.
I can't believe you were able to find that other call.
I heard mom's doing okay.
Yeah.
Some broken bones, lacerations. She'll heal.
Poor kid.
Can't even imagine what it must have been like for her.
Not just yesterday, but all those years seeing her dad put hands on her mom.
Yeah, I don't wish for anyone to go through what that girl and her mom have.
Me either.
Don't get me wrong.
My mom totally dated a bunch of losers after my dad died.
But none of them ever hurt her in that way.
And then she finally found my stepdad, so...
Happy ending.
(indistinct chatter) Dispatch 118 is at the sorority house.
This way!
Okay, let's make some room.
You have to help him, please. Please help Hoover.
(whining) EDDIE: That's a...
Yep.
You have to help him, please.
Okay, I want everybody to take a step back, including you.
He's in our hands now.
What do we do, Cap?
What we always do.
Start assessing the patient.
CHIMNEY: Let me take a look.
(Hoover whining) Got a pulse. Thready, but it's there.
EDDIE: Respirations are shallow.
I count six breaths a minute.
CHIMNEY: Got a lot of drool around the mouth.
Okay, hand me the Ambu bag. I'm gonna support his respirations.
Okay. Dispatch said this was an OD. What did this dog get into?
Nope, sorry.
I'm out.
What did he eat?
He found it on the floor.
He wasn't supposed to eat it.
You didn't think a dog named Hoover would eat anything he could find?
SHERYL: I don't know. Did President Hoover eat random things?
Hoover, like the vacuum.
Oh.
Oh. (cries) It's opioids.
How much was in there?
It wasn't mine. Someone must've brought it with them.
This isn't working. I lost his pulse.
It's an OD. How about Narcan?
Not a veterinarian. I've never given Narcan to an animal before.
Hen would know.
Thought we weren't supposed to call her.
It's an emergency, clearly.
What? You're... you're coding a what?
N-No, no. Hang on, hang on.
I need someone else to confirm this is actually happening.
Tell Buck what you're coding.
<i> Uh, it's a dog.</i> <i> OD'd on opioids.</i> Are you two drunk?
<i> BUCK:</i> <i> Absolutely.</i> It's 2:00 in the afternoon.
It's 5:00 somewhere.
(Hen laughs) <i> HEN:</i> <i> How much does it weigh?</i> 15 pounds, give or take. <i> Okay.</i> <i> Point oh four</i> kilograms per milligram.
That's six point eight...
<i> Two point seven</i> milligrams Narcan.
2.7.
Thanks, Hen.
Come on, buddy.
<i> EDDIE: All right.</i> <i> CHIMNEY: Ready?</i> Come on, buddy.
(barks) (students exclaim) Hoover!
GIRL: Oh, he's okay.
BOBBY: All right.
Come here, little buddy. Here we go.
Oh, wait.
Let's go.
Wait, where are you taking Hoover?
To a vet and then into protective custody.
That's a thing?
It is now.
Mm.
You did math in your head.
(chuckles) I know, right?
(laughs) Take that, doctor professor lady who flunked me.
She's an idiot.
Mm-hmm.
You know, so what-- you failed some stupid test, but your-your instincts...
are incredible.
You would have made one heck of a doctor.
Mm.
<i> BOY:</i> <i> Are you guys set</i> <i> for Logan's birthday party</i> <i> next weekend?</i> <i> You're going, right?</i> CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. Totally.
(blankets rustling) (Christopher continuing indistinctly) Logan said he would have anything, but his mom wouldn't let him.
Then Logan said that he was getting a batting cage for his birthday.
It's gonna be so cool.
Off. Now.
I got to go.
What do you think you're doing?
What part of "no video games for a week" don't you understand?
It's not fair. You never let me do anything on my own.
I'm not a baby, and you always treat me like one.
I don't<i> think</i> you're a baby, but you sure are acting like one.
And you're acting like a jerk!
Do not use that tone with me.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I don't want you to feel like a baby.
And I don't want you to think I'm a jerk.
But... okay.
Maybe sometimes I can't help myself.
You know, my instinct is to always protect you, Chris.
I don't need you to protect me.
Well, I'm not sure I know how to stop.
You're growing up on me, bud.
But you still need to respect me and to be honest with me.
We need to look out for each other.
You... Talk to each other about what we're going through, okay?
Okay.
And I love you, but when you break the rules, there are gonna be consequences.
And facing them is what makes you a young man.
And we've already established, clearly, that's what you are, right?
Right.
So once your punishment's over, we can...
talk about you going to the park and hanging out with your friends without me around.
Awesome. Thanks, Dad.
Don't thank me just yet, 'cause your punishment just got extended by one week.
Oh, come on.
No. Now get to bed.
Night, Dad.
Good night.
(indistinct announcement over P. A.) MADDIE: May I come in?
Hi, Claribelle.
How do you...
I'm Maddie.
Maddie?
Hi.
You were the one that sent the help?
Yes. Uh, and I brought someone that I think could help some more.
Hello, Lourdes. My name is Yvette.
I'm an immigration lawyer. I work with victims of domestic violence.
I don't understand.
Uh, Claribelle said that you were undocumented.
Stephen promised that he will get me my green card, but he never did.
He said that I could not get one without him.
He lied to you.
Under the Violence Against Women Act, you can self-petition.
You do not need to ask your abuser for anything.
So, I'll get to stay here?
I think we got a good shot.
And if all goes well, yes, you'll get to stay here.
LOURDES: Why?
Why would you do this for us?
I've been where you are.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
(sniffles) CLARIBELLE: Maddie, wait!
Thank you.
(chuckles) You are a very strong and smart girl.
You took good care of your mom.
Be proud of yourself.
I just did what she told me.
She taught me how to run.
No.
She taught you how to fight.
(chuckles softly) <i> DR. SIMMONS:</i> <i> I think we should move</i> these two bullet points to a new slide.
No one's gonna be able to read that.
Ms. Wilson.
I-I... I'm-I'm sorry to barge in.
Your office said you were in here.
Um, do you have a minute?
Why don't you get started on those changes.
We'll go through the rest later.
Okay.
Come on in.
(door closes) How can I help you?
Give me a second chance.
I-I have good instincts.
A-And a lot of paramedic experience in the field.
I-I care. I care about patients and saving lives.
I-I know that I completely bombed on my final.
But I also know that I could be a really good doctor.
How badly do you want to be a really good doctor?
Enough that I will put myself and my family through another 12 months of hell if I have to repeat this year.
But I'm really hoping I don't have to.
(scoffs softly) All right, Ms. Wilson.
I'll give you a second chance.
Next week.
A practical exam with me and my patients.
We will see just how good those instincts really are.
<i> (door opens)</i> <i> ATHENA: Bobby, are you home?</i> Hey.
Oh!
What are you doing home? I thought your flight was tonight.
Oh, Mama wanted her space back and Daddy sent me away, so I thought I'd catch an earlier flight to surprise you.
(laughs) Mwah.
Mwah.
Are you surprised?
Yes, I am. I'm happy to have you back home.
Ooh, something smells good.
What are you cooking? I'm starving.
Well...
Yeah, that's-that's not for us.
Oh, uh...
Uh, no, no... What is this?
Well, Athena, I would like you to meet Hoover.
Hmm.
(Hoover whines) Like the vacuum cleaner?
Exactly.
(Hoover whines) <i> BUCK:</i> <i> Thank you guys for</i> coming over.
I've been giving this a lot of thought.
Uh, thinking about, you know, wh-where I am in my life and what I want, and...
and how this would fit in with that.
And?
Uh, and honestly, I...
haven't figured any of that out.
(chuckles) I-I have no idea what I want.
But it is clear to me...
... that you know what you want.
And one thing I do know is-is that I-I want to help you have that.
Are you... are you saying what I think you're saying?
I'm saying yes.
I'm saying I will absolutely be your sperm donor.
Oh!
