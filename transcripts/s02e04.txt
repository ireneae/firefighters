(alarm blaring) (alarm stops) ("Milagro" by Gloria Estefan playing) Rise and shine, little man.
Let's do this.
Let's do this.
(Christopher grunting) Keep going, my little Superman.
Whoa.
Oh, a little bit too much.
Let's share it.
(sighs): Finally.
MADDIE: The Oxford Dictionary defines "rut" as "a habit or pattern of behavior that has become dull and unproductive but is hard to change." The word is also defined as "a long, deep track made by the repeated passage of the wheels of vehicles." There is some comfort to be taken in the second definition, for when you find yourself stuck in a rut, you can be sure others have been there before you.
(clattering) (indistinct chatter) Son of a bitch.
Dwayne, it's George.
Those ninja street artist guys are back again, man.
DWAYNE: Hold the button down. I can't hear you.
Hey! Don't you move.
No, no!
I said don't move!
Don't move!
(grunts) Come back! Oh, God!
(grunting) Aah!
LAFD. Step back.
GEORGE: Please help me! Please help me!
Someone help me, please!
CHIMNEY: Whoa.
Whatever you do, brother, don't suck in that gut.
BOBBY: How we doing, George?
I can't... I can't feel my legs.
And I think my ankle's broken.
HEN: Sir, you have any idea how long you've been down there?
I saw the sun come up.
Well, he's wedged in there pretty good.
How's your breathing?
I can't really take a deep breath.
Hey, George, can-can you show us how high up you can reach?
If we can drop you a line, we may be able to pull you up.
Okay.
HEN: Nice and slow, George.
BUCK: That's it.
(screams) Whoa, easy.
George, just...
keep hanging in there, we will get you out.
What are you thinking, Cap?
(knocking) Yes?
Ma'am, we need to access this unit.
Uh...
Let's go, start with the drill.
Uh, I'm in the middle of a private showing.
Hi.
(shouts) Oh, oh, oh, no!
(muffled): Help! Help!
A little high, boss. One second.
Someone get me out of here!
Sorry about that. One second.
That's your target.
(grunting) Why couldn't you go through the wall of the other building?
Ma'am, as I explained before, the wall in the other building is twice as thick.
It would take twice as much time.
And this is all gonna be taken care of.
Yeah. It's good to go, Cap.
All right, George, I'm-a need you to control your breathing and take shallow breaths.
(drill whirring) Let's get down there.
GEORGE: I think you should talk to me!
All right, we're almost there, George. How you holding up?
Uh, please hurry, 'cause...
I got to take a leak.
Okay, maybe hold off on that for a minute.
Okay, George, we're gonna start to pull you in here, but in order to do that, we're gonna have to pull on you pretty hard.
So you're probably gonna feel like you're falling, but you're not. If you start to panic and struggle, it's gonna be hard for us to get you in here. Do you understand?
Just don't dro... don't drop me, please.
I don't want to die.
Relax, everything's gonna be okay.
GEORGE: Okay.
All right?
All right, take a breath and just exhale. Ready?
GEORGE: Yeah.
One, two, three.
Start to pull.
Aah!
Here. Give me your hand. All right, you're safe.
(whimpering) All right.
Okay, you're home free, George. Watch your head. Okay.
You're okay. You're okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
HEN: All right, take it easy.
BOBBY: Okay, guys, on three: one, two, three.
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
You're gonna be just fine. You're gonna be just fine, okay?
Okay...
Who knew having a gut was gonna save my life?
Captain?
Athena. Come on in.
Would you shut the door behind you?
You look worried.
Well, I'm not sure we've ever had a good conversation that started with "shut the door behind you." Well, then, this will be a first.
You applied for a promotion to lieutenant four times, but then you stopped applying.
Why?
I was passed over... four times.
When I pressed the issue, I was told that, um, I didn't have the necessary leadership qualities for further advancement.
Conners, right?
Mm-hmm.
Spent the entire conversation staring at your chest?
I never understood what that was about.
Was it a sexual thing, or was he just constantly surprised that there were police officers who had breasts?
Well, he was a real son of a bitch.
Ugh.
May he rest in peace.
Conners was wrong about, well, everything, but specifically, about your leadership skills.
You're tough, but fair.
Well-respected with the officers under your command.
And I think you would make an excellent lieutenant.
Thank you, Captain. Um, but I haven't even thought about applying in years.
Maybe next year.
How about next week?
There's an opening in Northeast Division.
I'd like to recommend you for it.
It'd be on an interim basis while we backfill the usual procedures.
That fast?
We're shorthanded.
Recruitment is down and retirement is up.
The command structure's been hollowed out in the middle.
Well, that's, uh, a lot to think about.
Uh, can I have some time with it?
Yeah. Take a few days.
It's yours if you want it, Athena.
But if you don't, that's okay.
Either way, at least this time, it's your decision.
All right, bud.
Dad's running a little behind.
(grunting): Ah, come on.
Eddito.
EDDIE: Morning, Abuela.
Eddie. Help him out.
EDDIE: He wants to do it.
Hola, mi angel.
Hola.
Thank you for taking him.
Taking him is not a problem.
Giving him back-- that's the hard part.
Okay.
Edmundo.
Ah.
Where's the fire?
(laughs) (speaks Spanish) That's better. Now go to work.
Okay.
Okay. Mwah.
Later, buddy.
(speaking Spanish) WOMAN: Who like mimosas?!
Hi, 911. This is Tanya.
Hi, Tanya, this is Maddie, and this line is reserved for emergencies.
(laughing): No, I totally have an emergency.
I'm sorry. My friend is just laughing, and it's making me laugh, and...
Okay, I'm fine now, for real.
So, anyway, we're at Saddle Ranch on Sunset, and my friend just got her head stuck in a pipe.
What kind of pipe?
It's, like, metal, I think.
Is it a drainpipe, or a sewer?
TANYA: A sewer?
God, no. It's attached to this guy's truck.
You mean a tailpipe?
Yeah! That.
(siren wailing, horn honking) * On a lightning raid * Just like a river runs Grab a creeper and some blocks.
She's over here.
* Like a fire needs flame, oh Holy crap, you are hot.
(people cheering) * I gotta feel it * In my blood...
Okay, guys, the strippers are here.
BUCK: Excuse me, coming through.
BOBBY: All right, ladies, just give us some space. Thank you.
Excuse me, clear a path. Coming through, thank you, thank you... thank you.
CHIMNEY: Hi, what's her name?
Betty.
(muffled): Jennifer.
Sorry, I thought you meant my truck.
This is your truck?
Yeah, but it's not like I backed into her.
She did this out of her own free will.
You dared her to.
We were flirting.
Your idea of flirting with a girl is daring her to stick her head in your tailpipe?
Oh, man.
CHIMNEY: Hi, Jennifer. LAFD.
How you feeling?
Uh, pretty good, actually.
Except for this whole, you know, ginormous tailpipe on my head.
HEN: Hey, Jennifer, you're gonna feel me poking around.
We're just checking you out, okay?
All right.
Why is this tailpipe so large?
BRENT: It's custom.
Where'd she get these bruises on her arm?
That wasn't me.
It's from the bull.
She rode it, like, five times.
There's no way we're gonna get a collar on her.
I got it.
Get me out of this thing.
These things are meant to increase the power to the engine.
Yup.
TSA 230 saw should do the job.
Oh, yeah, like a knife through butter.
Chim?
Excuse me. Way ahead of you, Cap.
BRENT: What?!
No, I spent 1,200 bucks on that tailpipe.
You might want to close your eyes during this part.
Just type your number in my phone, and I'll text you so you have mine.
BUCK: Thanks, but I actually have a girlfriend, and I need to focus right now so my captain doesn't cut your friend's head off.
Hi. Do you have Snapchat?
No. And, uh, I don't think I'm what you're looking for.
I have... I have a son.
That's great. So do I.
JENNIFER: I think I'm gonna puke.
You better not.
These fire guys are totally hot.
All right, what say we move the peanut gallery a few steps over this way. Thank you.
Everybody back a little bit, thank you.
HEN: All right, Jennifer, keep your head completely still.
You're gonna hear a lot of noise, but everything is fine.
(saw whirring, grinding) JENNIFER: (squeals) What are you doing?!
BOBBY: All right, almost there.
HEN: Okay.
Easy.
BUCK: We need lube.
I have some.
Clutch.
EDDIE: Slowly. Slowly.
(applause) Wow, you really are hot.
Would you like us to transport you to the hospital, get checked out?
She just needs another drink.
No, what she needs to do is go home.
All three of you do, in a cab.
Listen to me. When you sober up, you feel like you have a headache or blurry vision, or you feel confused, you got to get yourself to a hospital, you understand?
(giggling) HEN: Condolences on Betty.
DARLENE: Are you okay?
JENNIFER: Actually, yeah.
Hey, so is your son really the reason you don't date?
That, and... they weren't my type.
Not mine either. Not anymore.
But I'm talking in general.
It's complicated when you have a kid.
Come on, that's a weak excuse.
You live in your invisible girlfriend's house, and you're telling me about weak excuses.
(mutters) (phone vibrating) Hello?
What?
Which one?
(indistinct announcement on P. A.) My aunt.
Tía. ¿Qué pasó? Is Christopher okay?
(sighs) Yes.
You mean Prince Charming, hmm? He's peachy.
(woman laughing) It's your abuela. She broke her hip.
What? How?
She was out back on the steps and calling him to come inside.
She lost her balance.
Christopher called 911.
The rescue got there really quick.
I want to see her.
No, she's sleeping now.
And, uh, who is this?
This is Buck. We work together.
Mm. I thought you just dressed alike.
This is my Aunt Josefina. Pepa.
Hi.
You can't keep doing this, Eddie.
You cannot keep leaving him with her.
She's not up to it.
I know. I know, and I'm sorry.
I... I'm trying to find some permanent help, it's just...
too many forms to fill out. It's worse than the V. A.
I can't believe your gringa ex stuck you with all of this.
I'm not stuck, Tia.
Do you have to go back to work?
Ah. And you're not stuck.
I'll keep him tonight, but you need to get this figured out.
Daddy. (laughs) Buddy.
Hey...
(grunts) (laughs) BUCK: Must be rough.
Raising any child alone is rough.
My nephew is a saint.
But I pray for him anyway.
(door opens) Hey.
Hey.
You guys have fun at your dad's?
Yeah.
It was fun.
We got you these on the way back.
Oh!
Thanks, baby. (laughs) Uh, but what's the occasion?
For your promotion.
Congratulations. It's about time.
Yes, it is. And we are so proud of you.
Thanks, but I haven't taken the job.
I'm still thinking about it.
What is there to think about?
You've been wanting this forever.
Why don't you guys go and put your stuff away.
Okay.
Okay, I don't get it.
I thought that you would be more excited about this.
Hell, I thought that you would be celebrating.
All these years-- the long hours, extra shifts.
You fighting to get recognized.
Athena, you work so hard, why are you not enjoying this moment?
I don't know. Maybe I'm just too tired.
All that fighting takes its toll.
When I joined the force, I was young and ambitious.
Enthusiastic.
It's just... (sighs) I keep thinking of the twentysomething me.
Her dreams, her goals.
She had a vision of what success looked like.
It was all about stars and bars, climbing up the ladder, blowing through that glass ceiling.
I don't need that anymore.
Success is now about...
those kids, this family.
People in my life who love me.
People out there who count on me.
I am finally in a place where I'm comfortable in my life and in my own skin.
I don't know if I want to upend that for a pay bump.
Oh. Oh, this...
this is not about a paycheck.
It's the recognition for all of your hard work.
Yeah, yeah, you're in a comfortable spot.
That doesn't mean that you should get stuck there forever.
Take a risk.
The next place might be better.
I do this too much?
We all agree, believe me.
(laughter) Christopher, I thought we were buddies-- what happened?
What's this?
I don't remember asking the chief for reinforcements.
You any good with a hose, kid?
I can try.
All right.
So sorry, Cap.
My aunt's trying to get off work early, but until then, I... I didn't know where to take him.
Yeah, you did. Right here. Buck gave me a heads-up. I already cleared it with the chief.
(alarm ringing) MAN (over P. A.): Attention, station...
All right, let's go, let's go!
All right, buddy.
Okay.
PD is on the scene with a possible entrapment.
(laughing) These are great, see, 'cause we can talk to each other.
Though sometimes I wish I had a mute button for Buck.
(truck horn honks) Oh, I'm sorry, were you saying something?
* Something ain't right, I'm so scared... * You have a scar on your head.
That's very observant, kid.
I had an accident.
Got a big metal rod stuck in my head, but the doctor took care of it.
You ever have surgery?
Two times.
Actually, three times.
Well, you got me beat.
Now I feel kind of lame.
Because you are.
(laughing) Your dad ever tell you why we call him Chimney?
No.
No. No, no, no, no.
I'll tell you the story later.
(car alarm blaring) * Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right... * Hey, can you grab the Jaws?
Now, you see, her air bags went off, so that protected her.
She's gonna be fine. You know what happens sometimes?
CHRISTOPHER: People get stuck.
BOBBY: That's right, people get stuck.
But we have a tool called the Jaws of Life.
And that's what your dad's gonna use right now.
Thanks to him, she's gonna make it home for dinner.
Yeah.
Yeah.
* Please...
All right, Christopher, come on over here. Ready?
Nice.
Christopher, here we go. Here we go.
Good job. Look at that. You're doing it.
Did you get a bonus already? Look at how good you are.
You're a natural.
* And I can see it makes no sense at all * (growls) * Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor... * What do you think? Is it good?
Yeah.
EDDIE: Come down, bud.
One more firefighter. Look at that! Yay!
(all cheering) Whoa.
CHIMNEY: Good job.
You nailed it, kid. (laughs) All right, fun's over.
Aw...
Bye, Christopher.
Later, Christopher.
Bye, Christopher.
Bye.
HEN: See you next time.
CHRISTOPHER: Bye.
EDDIE: Come on, bud.
Good job today, kiddo.
You, too, Cap.
(chuckling) Hola, mi amor. Okay, vamanos.
See you later.
PEPA: Okay. Did you have fun?
Be careful there, baby.
Thanks, Cap.
I just feel bad for him, you know?
Eddie, I mean. Not Christopher.
Christopher's great. He's smart, adorable, funny, in a kid way.
He just needs a little extra help.
Cerebral palsy, right?
Aunt Pepa said he got stuck in the birth canal. There were some complications, and then...
Well, did Aunt Pepa explain what's happening with the child care situation?
Because there are programs.
Eddie's working on it. He's got insurance.
And there's other stuff through the city, state and county, but the requirements are all different.
You can apply for one, and it can disqualify you from another.
It's a whole, giant bureaucratic mess.
I-I can't get my head around it.
I was a nurse, remember? The only people who truly navigate a bureaucracy are the people who work inside it.
It shouldn't be that way, though-- Eddie, always wondering how to take care of Christopher, and Christopher feeling like a burden on his dad.
Eddie doesn't feel that way, does he?
Not even a little.
He, uh, loves that kid like crazy.
He's a really great dad.
So, does this boy crush on Eddie mean that you're finally ready to, uh, move on from Abby?
That's cute.
I have some news.
I found an apartment. It's not far from work.
Two bedrooms, secure building.
Parking included.
So you're really moving out?
I told you that I wasn't gonna be able to live here forever.
Look, when I left Doug, I didn't have a plan.
I just grabbed up all my stuff and ran as fast and as far as I possibly could, but then you convinced me to start over, make a brand new life in L. A.
I was right about that.
You were.
But it's just not gonna feel like mine unless I'm standing on my own two feet.
That's the only way I'm gonna know it's real.
MRI TECH: You ready, Mr. Han?
No matter how many times I do this, I hate being stuck in this thing.
Yeah.
Try not to move your head.
It's extraordinary-- to think that just ten months ago you had that stuck through your skull.
As always, your bedside manner totally sucks, doc.
(laughs) I-I apologize, it's...
34 years in neurology, I have never seen anything like it.
You're a modern medical miracle.
Yeah?
Uh, to be honest, I still don't remember much of it.
Well, as we've discussed, some amnesia around such a traumatic event-- it's to be expected.
Did we discuss that?
I'm just joking.
All right, so how we looking?
Excellent.
As you can see, no sign of traumatic brain injury.
You're exactly where you were two months ago.
Fantastic.
Tatiana?
Hi, Chimney.
You doing the math in your head?
No.
Uh, yes.
Don't worry, unless this is the longest-incubated baby in human history, she's my husband's.
Oh.
So, you're married, too?
Yeah.
I'm glad that I ran into you.
I've been wanting to call, but what do you say?
"Sorry that I was so awful and broke up with you "without even calling when you were laid up in the hospital with a metal pipe in your head?" Yes, those words exactly, actually.
Except it was rebar, not a pipe.
Everything else okay, I mean, like, on the inside?
Yeah, just got another clean bill of health.
I'm a miracle.
In more ways than one.
That whole experience woke me up, not just to how fragile life is, but to the kind of person that I was.
So I went to that clinic up north where you spend ten days looking at your life, tearing apart your personality, and figuring it all out.
I'm very happy for you.
No, you're not.
Which is fair.
How's your life? I mean, anyone special?
Uh... not at the moment, no.
But I did a firefighter calendar.
I'm Mr. April.
Oh.
That's great.
Send me one if you want.
(elevator bell dings) I'll wait for the next one.
MORRIS (muffled): Help! Help!
It's hot in here!
I do not give my consent to use my face on whatever show this is.
Okay, ma'am, it sounds like you should be calling your bank.
WOMAN: It told me to call 911.
I'm sorry?
A note came out of the thingy.
It says someone's stuck inside.
I know it sounds crazy, but I think I can hear someone yelling from in there.
Inside the machine? Are you sure?
I'm sure I don't have my money.
BUCK: The only way she knows it's real is for her to live in a two-bedroom apartment in Eagle Rock.
What does that even mean?
I think it means she's not comfortable squatting in some stranger's condo.
Abby's not a stranger.
Hi.
Hi.
HEN: So she has a new life. Great. So do you.
No, that's the point. I don't have a new life.
I have the same life.
You should be grateful. You almost died, Chim.
Exactly: I almost died and I didn't.
I had a life-altering trauma, and her life got altered.
All I got was the trauma.
Welded hinges.
Yup.
Bank said they sent a technician out this morning to replace the lock on the vault.
Found his van in the lot.
Cell phone was in the passenger seat.
Best guess is he got locked inside the vault with no way to call out.
Help!
BUCK: Sir, we're gonna get you out of there.
Help! Can you hear me?!
Oh. There he is.
HEN: Did you expect her to wait?
How about at least until I came out of my coma?
And by the looks of her belly, I'm pretty sure she was getting busy while that rebar was still in my head.
I just feel like it's all happening too fast.
I mean, how many years did it take her before she was ready to leave Doug?
That hardly feels like the same thing.
My point is she just got here and now she's leaving again.
Buck, she's moving to Eagle Rock, not Alaska.
It's ten minutes from your place. Abby's place.
Your sister's building a new life for herself.
Be proud of her.
I should be happy for her, right?
She did apologize, not just for how it ended, but before, too.
She said she felt like maybe she had been a bitch.
She's not lying. She was a bitch.
What? You're my friend. She's your ex.
You get to forgive and move on.
I get to hold a grudge until I die.
You think it's weird I still live in Abby's place?
Yes.
Me, too. Don't tell anyone.
It was fine at first, you know? She was just gonna be gone for a few months and I wanted to be supportive, but she still hasn't come back and I don't know what to do.
I'm just...
Stuck. That's how I feel.
I almost died and my life is exactly the same as it was before.
It's not like I woke up out of a coma and, suddenly, I know how to play the piano or speak a foreign language.
Chimney, I think you're setting your expectations too high.
No, I think I'm setting them too low.
We hardly ever even talk, you know?
It's always time zone issues or cell phone problems.
Did you know she's been in Morocco over a week?
(Morris shouting inside) No, I did not know that.
No, me neither.
Found out yesterday on Instagram.
(grunts) I still love Abby, and I want her to be happy.
How long do I have to wait before I get to be happy, too?
(grunts): Got it.
All right, we got it.
Step back. Ready?
I don't know this Abby person, but I've never been happier to see anyone in my life.
You like the classics, don't you?
I'm sorry?
Your eye is drawn to the more traditional, classic setting.
This one here.
It's our most popular engagement ring, and with good reason. Would you like to see it?
No. (stammers) No, no thank you.
But, uh, you could show me the box it comes in.
Excuse me? You-you want to see the box?
Yeah, uh, I already, uh... (chuckles) I already have the-the ring.
I'm not crazy, I-I-I promise.
My girlfriend-- my soon to be fiancé... (chuckles) I hope-- a few months after we met, I-I bought her an expensive diamond necklace from this very store.
Oh, nice.
Yeah.
And she pawned it.
Then donated the money to an animal shelter.
Isn't that... sweet.
So, I-I kind of just-just want the box, if-if that's okay?
Sure.
Seriously? You still haven't left yet?
Daniel, I have to be back at work in an hour.
DANIEL: Ariel, turn around.
Ariel Simone...
(Ariel gasps) I love you to the moon and back.
Will you marry me?
(laughing): Yes! Of course I'll...
Daniel!
(screaming) BOBBY: LAFD, coming through.
Hey, I guess they'd been working on the escalator overnight.
The floor panel on the landing-- it must not have been put back securely.
Daniel, help is here.
The fire department is here.
Please tell me he's gonna be okay. Please help him.
We're gonna do everything we can, okay? We're...
They're gonna it over from here. What's his name?
It's Daniel.
Hey, Daniel, can you hear me?
We got to get this step out of here.
BUCK: One, two, three.
BOBBY: All right, Chim, you're on.
* Ask me no questions, I will tell you no lies * I got a pulse, guys.
Oh, thank God!
Daniel, can you hear me?
Ariel... No, I need to see her for... Aah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, buddy.
(moaning) I need you to stay very still, okay?
But I want you to keep talking to me.
I was, uh...
proposing to-to my girl.
All right, talk to me, Chim. What do you got?
It's not good.
What's happening? Why are you stopping?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy.
The chain is sitting on top of his femoral artery.
It's possible it's even nicked it.
Loosening might make it worse.
Tension's acting as a tourniquet, could be keeping him from bleeding out.
All right, let's get him out of there. Chim, tie him off.
Hen, get an I. V., run it wide open.
Copy that.
* But if love is enough (grunting) * Could you let it show * Let it show * * If you feel it, could you...
Clipping the wires and chain.
(chain snaps) Aah! (moaning) CHIMNEY: I know it hurts, just relax, let me get you out of here.
Daniel!
Okay, try to relax, try to breathe.
We're gonna get you out of here.
DANIEL: Oh, God! Aah!
(screams) Try to relax, try to relax.
I'm gonna get you out of here, all right? I know it hurts, just relax. We're gonna get you out of here.
(Daniel moaning) CHIMNEY: Okay, on three.
One, two... three!
(screams) See? He's coming out, he's coming out. It's all right.
I'm gonna help, okay?
Here, I got him, I got him.
* But if love * Is enough could you let it show * * Let it show * (applause) * If you feel it, could you let me know * What did she say?
* If you feel it, could you let me know? * I think she said yes, buddy.
(coughs) * For a miracle.
Blood pressure's dropping.
Breathing is shallow.
Daniel, can you hear me?
I can't find a pulse.
He's in cardiac arrest. One...
Daniel? Oh, please, God.
Ma'am, you have to stand back. Let them do their job, okay?
(monitor slowly beeping) (flatline) Chim.
He's gone.
* (crying) Daniel...
(sobbing) * You all right?
No, I don't know, uh, that I am.
(sighs) I lived, Cap.
(sniffles) I'm alive.
Yeah, you are.
Why?
How come I survived and that poor guy back there didn't?
I mean...
his life was about to change, right?
He had so much to live for.
So do you.
Do I?
Something happened to me that was supposed to be life-changing, and nothing changed.
It's like everything just stopped.
I feel like I died that night.
I mean, I just keep replaying everything in my head, all those moments on the freeway-- the look on your face, being wheeled into the ER...
I thought you didn't remember any of that.
I remember it all.
(sniffles) Everything.
Wakes me up in the middle of the night. I just can't...
You kept telling everybody that you had no memory of it.
I know.
Why?
I don't know, I just...
I guess it's easier to not talk about it, but it's always there on my mind, I just... I don't want to recount it as some sort of freak show form of en... entertainment.
I just want it to go away, it's...
You know, Chim...
... a life-changing event can't change your life if you keep pretending it didn't happen.
You got to talk about it, man, you got to let it out, process it.
You feel like you're still trapped in that car, don't you?
Sitting helpless on that freeway.
Well, you're not on that freeway, and you're not helpless, Chim.
You're right here, pal.
So are all the people who love you.
All right.
Come here.
(sniffles) Thought you said we were helping your sister move.
Doesn't look like she's packed anything.
Oh, this stuff is Abby's.
I lied about the whole moving thing.
I mean, my sister is moving, it's just...
she doesn't really have that much stuff.
What's going on, Buck?
I asked you here 'cause there's someone I want you to meet.
You didn't set me up, did you?
No, just-just trust me.
This woman is... exactly what you need.
(knocking) She's here.
Buckaroo!
(laughs) Carla. (chuckles) Baby... Ah! Goodness, I missed your face.
BUCK (laughs): Oh, I missed you, too. Come on in.
Uh, Eddie, this-this is my friend Carla.
Nice to meet you, Eddie.
Likewise.
Carla is L. A.'s finest home health care aid.
She has years of experience navigating giant bureaucracies, and I thought she could help you figure out how to get Christopher what he needs.
I'm red tape's worst nightmare.
(laughs) I'll get you through this in no time.
Now, let's go sit down and let's see what you're working with.
Besides that perfect bone structure.
Hi. I'm actually looking for somebody.
Hi.
Seeing you the other day really threw me.
I spent months thinking about what I wanted to say to you.
And then you were there, and...
and my mind just went blank.
I just... I didn't know what to say, so...
I get it. That's why I'm here.
So, whatever you need to say, I'm-I'm ready to hear it.
Thank you.
I-I'm glad that you didn't pretend with me after my accident.
It's not what either us needed.
You see, all I did was pretend with you the entire time we were together, just...
pretending to be something that I wasn't.
Uh, telling you stories of things that I had never done, adventures that I'd never had.
Why?
I guess I always thought that being just me wasn't enough.
(chuckles) It's enough.
It's more than enough.
Thanks. (chuckles) Here.
(mouths) (chuckles) It's for the baby.
I figured.
That's cute.
And this...
is for you.
(laughs): Wow.
Very nice.
I really want you to have a blessed life, Tatiana.
I want the same for you.
Well, I guess I'll just have to do that, then, huh?
What's going on?
I can hear you thinking.
This about the promotion?
I have to give Maynard my decision before my shift starts.
You're worried she's gonna think less of you when you turn it down?
How did you know I'm turning it down?
Everyone else I've told assumes, of course, I'm taking it.
I'd be crazy not to.
I don't think it's crazy to be happy with what you have.
To feel satisfied it's enough.
Is it enough?
I like being out there, seeing with my own eyes what's really going on in the world, doing my job, helping where I can.
then coming home at the end of the day and letting it all go.
Know what I mean?
Hey, I became a firefighter 'cause I didn't want to be behind a desk.
In the truck, with my team-- that's what I want for as long as they'll let me have it.
There's nothing wrong with that.
No, there isn't.
You think you can sleep now?
(chuckles) Maybe not just yet.
MADDIE: We all get stuck from time to time.
In our circumstances, in our fear, stuck on a page we haven't yet been able to turn.
So this is really everything, huh?
Yeah. Unless you want to give me some of Abby's dishes.
I'll accumulate stuff. That's part of starting over.
And when we're feeling stuck, or even just a little too comfortable, if we're very lucky, someone will be there...
(indistinct chatter) (chuckles) (gasps) Hola, mi amor.
All right.
Hi. (speaks Spanish) Oh, who is that? Who is that?
MADDIE: ... to give us a little push.
Or a kick in the pants.
Or just offer a hand...
(speaking Spanish) ... to help us get unstuck.
You've answered the call on 9-1-1.
Now here are a few more shows to check out from Fox.
Buckle up, buttercup.
It's real, and it pulls people together.
