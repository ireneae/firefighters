<strong>Sadie</strong>: <em>My girlfriends keep telling me a new face won't win him back.</em>
Who says I want him back? I don't. I want <em>me</em> back.
Actually, I want the 35-year-old version of me back.
You think you'll be able to knock 15 years or so off me?
Without a doubt.
Just don't make me look like a duck.
(<em>Power tool whirring</em>)
What are you planning to use on me?
They're just doing some construction next door.
Relax. Breathe normally.
Count backwards from ten, and when you wake up, you'll be ten years younger.
Fifteen.
(<em>Hammering outside</em>)
Ten, (<em>Echoing, distorting</em>): nine, eight, seven...
(<em>Classical piano playing</em>)
Are we done?
Doctor? Mm.
How do I look?
Hello?
(<em>Screaming</em>)
(<em>Phone ringing in distance</em>)
<strong>Chimney</strong>: What are we thinking? Gas leak?
<strong>Hen</strong>: Could be some pathogen.
World's a crazy place these days.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Negative for combustibles as of now.
Masks stay on for the duration.
<strong>Buck</strong>: Where is everyone? It's too quiet.
Got one over here.
She's got a pulse.
Pupillary response... normal.
<strong>Sadie</strong>: Help! Please help!
Please help me.
Oh, help me. They're crushing me.
Okay, Buck, give me a hand over here.
Chimney, you check on her.
Wha-Wha-What's wrong?
Stop, stop, stop!
Don't touch your face. Don't touch your face.
What the...?
Ma'am, it just looks like the staff here just wasn't 100% done before they lost consciousness.
You're still under the effects of the general anesthesia, which is good.
Okay, we're gonna keep you nice and numb.
But I'm gonna need to put a cold compress on your face, okay?
Is there a stitch loose?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Look, you're probably gonna feel cold, but you're not gonna feel any pain.
We've got to preserve as much tissue as possible when we travel you to a hospital.
Tissue? Oh, my face is off!
My face is off!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Same symptoms over here, Cap.
She's sleeping like a baby, but she's stable.
(<em>Sadie gasping</em>)
<strong>Bobby</strong>: They run the anesthesia lines through the walls in these places, don't they?
What are you thinking, a leak or a rupture?
Yeah, then why isn't she out?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Looks like she's receiving oxygen from the nasal cannula.
Eddie, you copy?
Yeah, Cap.
<em>What's your status?</em>
Found a couple more patients in back.
<em>Also stable.</em>
I'm gonna send Chim your way.
You guys see if you can locate the tank supply room.
You turn anything off that's got a knob or a valve in this place.
A pipe must have busted, yeah?
Probably the construction guys.
You saw construction guys?
I heard 'em, right before I went under.
I don't hear anything now.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: I got this guy over here.
Chimney, grab the guy on the table.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: On it.
Sir, can you hear me?
Stable here.
This one's breathing.
(<em>Grunting</em>) This guy won't budge.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Cap, found our leak.
Okay, let's see what we have here.
Plugging the leak now.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: <em>Copy that, Eddie.</em>
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Right. So there's that. Hey, Eddie, I need your help over here. Grab some tools.
What do you need? Saws? Jaws?
Wrench. We'll have to travel him with the blade.
Easy. Easy.
Okay, that's got to sting.
<strong>Man (<em>weakly</em>)</strong>: Measure twice, cut once.
(<em>Groaning</em>)
Just lie still, buddy, we got you.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Okay, we're good here. Let Mercy General know we're ten out.
Measure twice, cut... (<em>Groans</em>)
Make a hole. Critical.
Don't worry, we're gonna take you to the hospital and they will fix you right up.
You'll still get your new beginning with your new face.
I'd be happy if I could just have the old one back.
(<em>Door opens</em>)
We're here.
Uh, they're not here yet.
Ah.
Hey, you can still make your escape.
Uh, you know what, just put your stuff away before your grandparents get here.
Yeah.
Right?
Oh, this is nice.
Very, very impressive.
Well, impressive is what I'm going for, so thank you.
Can you stay? Will you join us?
Oh, hell no, thank you.
Beatrice has never been a fan of mine.
You have no earthly idea what is about to happen to you, do you? (<em>Laughs</em>)
Tell 'em I said hi.
We're here.
Oh, man.
<strong>Harry</strong>: Grandma! Grandpa!
How I have missed these faces.
(<em>Laughs</em>)
You still here?
I thought you'd drop the kids and run.
Well, they wouldn't jump out of the car while it was still rolling.
Oh...
Remember, no matter what happens, they leave on Saturday.
(<em>Indistinct chatter</em>)
Beatrice, how you doing? It's good to see you.
Michael, what a pleasant surprise.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Uh, Mama, uh, Daddy, this is Bobby.
Hi.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Carter.
Oh, no need for that.
Christian names'll do. Call me Samuel.
Will do.
Boy, that's a good-looking spread. (<em>Chuckles</em>)
He living here already?
Uh, no, ma'am.
Not until after the wedding.
And it's a pleasure to finally meet you.
You're very... tall.
So, Michael, will your husband be joining us?
Oh, no.
Uh, Glenn and I aren't actually married.
Mm. Of course you're not married yet.
You're barely divorced.
Uh, Saturday, you said?
Mm-hmm.
There you go. Just keep that tight. Nice.
You are on fire with that sassy new haircut.
Sassy?
Yeah.
Okay, let's, uh, let's work on that two-three-two combo.
Okay, I want you to be ready with that devastating hook is you ever see Doug again.
Whoa. That is not why I'm doing this.
Really? You, uh, you don't want to kick your abusive ex's ass someday?
'Cause I would.
I'm not doing anything for Doug anymore, okay?
This is just the next chapter in Maddie's fresh start.
Come on, haircut, apartment, dispatcher of the month. I don't know if you heard.
About a thousand times. Come on.
Oh, is that what this is about? I'm thriving, and you can't handle it.
I'm great.
Oh, yeah, you're doing great.
You're still sleeping in my dining room.
By the way, what happened to Earthquake Girl?
Your trash talk sucks.
Ali's around.
We're taking it slow.
She's, uh, she's in New York on business.
Why is it that every girl you date wants to either flee the state of the country?
At least when I date someone, I date them.
What's your excuse?
What are you talking about?
Uh-huh.
How's Chimney?
(<em>Exhales</em>)
Chimney? We're friends.
Except, ooh, you want to date him.
I never told you that.
Oh, you didn't have to.
Your fists are saying it. Intensity and speed notched up, like, 20% the second I mentioned his name.
Okay, easy. Let me ask you this.
You're doing so well, you're-you're &quot;thriving.&quot;
Why can't you just date the guy?
<strong>Chimney</strong>: <em>I don't know.</em>
I mean, we like the same things, we laugh at the same jokes.
Even better, she laughs at all mine, and I'm not even that funny.
You don't think she's seeing anybody else, do you?
No. I'm telling you, her ex really did a number on her.
I'm not saying he ruined her for anybody else, but...
Come on, man, no hook-ups?
No foreplay, nothing?
No.
Right now we're all awkward hugs and funny glances.
A screwball comedy without the screw?
Corner pocket.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Oh, too bad.
So, maybe it's time you moved on to greener pastures.
Take the hint.
Well, that's the thing about me.
I'm bad with hints. I even suck at Pictionary.
Yeah.
You know you've been singing the same sad song about this woman ever since we started coming here?
I'm starting to think I should have mailed that wallet back to you after I found it, instead of returning it in person and striking up this misguided friendship.
Well, honestly, the only reason I keep coming here with you is I know there was a $20 bill in that wallet when I lost it, and I'm just trying to win it back.
Ooh.

I don't understand why your mother would reorganize the entire kitchen while we're at work.

So she retaliated by making it impossible for us to find anything?
Found it.
Ah. Thank you.
Ooh, the dress is lovely.
Very elegant. (<em>Chuckles</em>)
Thank you.
Did you pick that out?
Yeah.
(<em>Samuel muttering</em>)
What is this?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Oh, that is Harry's science project.
Michael had that conference, so I was helping him out with it.
Harry was supposed to put it away, but tell you what...
I will move it.
That boy has you wrapped around his finger.
You do know someday soon you're gonna have to go from being best buddy Bobby to stepdad Bobby.
You are right. I will have him put it away.
If you can help me find the damn cheese grater, please.
I'm sorry to interrupt, guys.
Hey, Harry. I need you to clear the table so we can eat.
Okay. In a minute.
No, not in a minute. Now.
Please.
Who are you to give orders?
They are not your children, and you are not their father.
I was very sorry to hear about your family's situation, but my grandchildren are not your consolation prize.
Kids.
I'm sorry, I...
(<em>Door closes in distance</em>)
Apologize, Mama.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: It's all right, Athena, she doesn't have...
Yeah, she does.
If she wants to stay in this house tonight, she does.
(<em>Takes deep breath</em>)
I'm sorry I said that in front of the children.
You shouldn't have said it at all.
It is none of your business.
I am tired of you deciding what's my business, Athena.
You didn't tell me you were seeing this man, much less that he proposed.
Just like last year.
My baby May almost died, and you didn't say a word for over a month?
Because she is not your baby girl. She's mine.
And Michael and I needed to focus all of our energy and our attention on her, not you.
I would have wanted to help.
You never want to help.
You just want to tell me where I screwed up.
Because you never learn.
You just jump into everything without thinking it through, without considering the consequences.
&quot;I'm gonna move to Los Angeles.&quot;
&quot;I'm gonna drop out of law school.&quot;
&quot;I'm gonna become a cop.&quot;
&quot;I'm gonna marry a gay man.&quot;
&quot;I'm gonna marry a white man.&quot;
Sometimes I think it's a miracle those kids are alive...
(<em>Stammering</em>)
Okay, that's enough.
<strong>Samuel</strong>: Bobby's right.
Now, we all should just take a minute, let things calm down.
Sir, with all due respect, I have to say that your daughter is an amazing woman and a damn good mother, and she does not deserve to be spoken to that way in her own home.
Your mother was out of line.
Bea...

9-1-1, what's your emergency?
<em>Um, hi.</em>
Hello? This is 911. Who's this?
<em>Um, Stevie.</em>
Okay, Stevie, my name is Maddie.
Where are you calling from?
<em>Our house. 1963 Aldrich Drive, Glendale.</em>
What's going on?
<em>It's... it's my dad.</em>
Your dad? Is he hurt?

This is 911 emergency services.
<em>You called 911?
([i]Sighs</em>) Oh, boy.
This is a little embarrassing, but my son here, he got himself into some trouble, and now he's grounded, and apparently that constitutes a life-and-death situation when you're 13 years old.
I can't tell you how sorry I am that we wasted your time.[/i]
It happens. Uh, are you sure that everyone's okay?
<em>No, yeah, everyone's fine. Yes, thank you.
Although I know somebody whose grounding just got a little bit longer.
Sorry to have bothered you.</em>
(<em>Line clicks</em>)
Hey.
So, I kind of got a disturbing call.
Disturbing how?
Well, it was a kid who said that his dad had done something bad, but before he could tell me what happened, the dad got on the line and said that the kid had been grounded and it was nothing.
And you think there was more to it than that?
Honestly...
I'm not sure.
Well, why don't you request a welfare check.
Have the police take a look, see if Dad's story checks out, give yourself some peace of mind.
Right.
And stop questioning your instincts.
You're coming into your own without even realizing it.
Thank you.

Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Mr. Eric Parnell?
That's right.
I'm Sergeant Grant for the LAPD.
I'm here to follow up on a 911 call made from this address.
May I come in?
Sure. Of course. Please.
Can't believe they really sent someone out for this.
I explained to the 911 operator that my son...
Sir, where is your son?
I'd like to speak with him if I could.
Sure.
Just a minute.
<strong>Eric</strong>: Sergeant?
Stevie, this is Sergeant Grant.
Do you know why she's here?
Because I called 911?
Because you called 911.
Sir, I'd like to speak with your son for a minute.
Alone.
Of course.
I'll go unload the dishwasher.
Why don't we talk outside?
<em>Stevie...</em>
I want you to know you're not in any trouble.
I'm just here to make sure that you're okay.
Because if you're not... If you need help...
All you have to do is say so.
I'm here to help.
I'm okay.
I was just mad.
At your father?
You want to tell me why?
He wants to change stuff.
I liked things the way that they were.
But he, uh...
He what?
He wasn't happy with me.
He... I got scared.
I see.
It's just you and your father, is it?
Okay. Well... you know calling 911's a serious thing, right?
Yeah.
Which is why I have to wonder if maybe the reason you called is a little more serious than just being grounded.
No, no, that's all it was. I swear.
Please, you just have to tell my dad that everything's okay.
I-I just don't want him to be mad at me anymore.
I understand, I do.
Our parents' approval is something that we all crave.
We just can't let it stop us from doing the right thing.
Understand?
I-I think so.
All right.
If you in trouble, you can always call for help, or if you need some help trying to figure out the right thing to do, you can call me directly.
I won't need to.
So... everything good?
Or will you be taking my son into custody?
No, everything's just fine. Thank you for your cooperation.
Anytime. Stevie?
<strong>Athena</strong>: Bye, Stevie.
Bye.
Have a nice day, Sergeant.
You, too, sir.
So he seemed fine?
Well, I said there were no marks on him that I could see, but fine? I'm not so sure.
That's why I want to hear the call.

<strong>Romero</strong>: Eric Lawrence Parnell. 42.
Single. Works as a freelance I.T. guy.
Grew up at this address. Mom died in '03, left him the house. He's clean, Sergeant.
Mm, mm-hmm. Clean, or maybe just careful.
And the son?
<strong>Romero</strong>: Steven Parnell. 13.
Enrolled at Los Nietos Middle School. Counselor says he's a average student.
Quiet. Keeps to himself.
Except when he's calling 911.
So what do you think's going on in that house, Sergeant?
I don't know yet, but I got a gut feeling something ain't right.
Well, your gut's good enough for me, but, um, there's no reason for you to be sitting out here staring at the man's garbage.
Me and my guys can handle this.
I'm sure you'd rather be home with the family.
No, I'm good.
My mother's in town. She said she's leaving, but she can't seem to find a flight out.
Ah.
Got it.
See you back at the station, Billy.
Anything in particular you think we should be looking for?
No. Nothing in particular, just let me know what you find.
You got it.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: <em>I didn't know what to say.</em>
I figured I should stay out of it, but then...
Mama got mean. (<em>Chuckles</em>)
Look, there's a whole spectrum of mom A-types.
You got the cool mom, you got the helicopter mom, you got the tiger mom, and then you got Beatrice.
Yeah, terrifying mom.
She named her daughter after a Greek god.
Yeah, Athena, goddess of wisdom.
And war.
Also the goddess of crafting, but that's a whole other story.
(<em>Chuckles</em>) The point is, Beatrice had big dreams for Athena and even bigger expectations, but she knows how this world works.
How hard Athena would have to fight for everything.
So child-rearing was less about raising a daughter and more like training a warrior.
So, no shopping trips, manicures, and long talks over cups of tea?
(<em>Laughs</em>) Maybe in a TV commercial.
But in real life?
No one gets under their daughter's skin like a mom.
Well, what am I supposed to do, just forget it?
Just forget all the mean things she said to her?
Bobby, you said your piece.
You had Athena's back. Props to you, by the way.
But, yeah.
They'll work it out, or they won't.
Either way, you do not want to be the man standing between them.
You'll get cut down in the crossfire.
Your mother ever say those kind of terrible things to you?
Oh, no, no, no. My mother, she said a whole bunch of different other terrible things.
And you forgave her?
She's my mother.
(<em>Grunts softly</em>)
(<em>Indistinct chatter</em>)
Hey.
What are you doing here? Looking for Buck?
No, actually, I came to see you, give you this.
Oh. Okay.

This is, uh, a really big step, Maddie.
I mean, he's gonna know where you are.
You sure about this?
Yeah, I know it's a risk.
But the only way I'm ever gonna feel free of him is to be free of him.
Okay. If you're sure, then, uh, I'm here for you, whatever you need.
Well, you told me once that your calendar was wide open, when I was ready.
Just, uh, name the date and time.
Friday, 7:00 p.m.
Actually, I'm kind of busy.
I'm kidding.
Yes. I can't wait.

Uh, sorry, I got to cancel our thing on Friday.
<em>You got to work?</em>
No, actually, um, it's Maddie.
She asked me out on a date.
Wow.
I guess I was wrong about her.
<em>Yeah.</em>
Uh, sorry again. So, drinks are on me next time I see you.
<em>No worries.</em>
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other real soon.
<em>Okay. See you.</em>
You find anything interesting?
Only this.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Mm-hmm, ladies' hair dye. Black hair dye.
Probably explains the substance you found in the sink.
You spoke to the boy, his hair look dyed to you?
No. And unless it caused Parnell's to fall out, it wasn't his either. Sketchy, but not grounds for a warrant.
And probably what's not got you so excited to call me down here.
We pulled prints, we got a hit, but not Eric Parnell's. The son.
You telling me little Stevie Parnell is a felon?
No, I'm telling you Stevie Parnell is not Stevie Parnell.
His real name is Jacob Daniel Walters, and he went missing in Merced, California in 2012.
Snatched off the streets.
He was six years old.
My God.
Yup. The original investigators pulled Jacob's prints back in the day.
It's a match, no doubt about it.
What now?
Let's go. Move, move, move.
<em>Bravo in position.</em>
Bravo, ready.
Alpha in position.
Go, go, move.
Clear.
Clear.
All clear.
All clear.
Place is empty.
Gone?
Yeah.
(<em>Sighs</em>) We'll put out an Amber Alert.
Your visit must've spooked him.
He didn't look spooked last night when we were sitting outside. You think he made us?
Sergeant.
Yeah?
You should see this.
Doesn't look like a 13-year-old's been sleeping here.
How old did you say Stevie was when Parnell took him?
<strong>Romero</strong>: Six.
Then your Amber Alert should specify adult male traveling with two minor boys, one 13... and the other probably six.
Let me take a look at that.
Thanks.
<strong>Romero</strong>: Yeah.
Yeah, okay. Thanks.
Just checked with the boy's school... he never made it.
Amber Alert's gone out, and we may even have ID on the second victim.
A six-year-old boy was abducted three days ago in Dana Point. Brian Gallagher.
I think you should clear your people out of here, Detective, and get anything marked off the street.
I'm not convinced this man fled.
I mean, I think maybe he just went out.
He didn't take anything out of the closet or the prescriptions in the kitchen cabinet.
Maybe he was in a hurry.
That could be, but I think something else is going on here, just not sure what.
There's a caller by the name of Stevie Parnell on the line.
He's asking for you.
Maddie, the boy's currently the subject of an Amber Alert.
<strong>Maddie</strong>: Stevie?
<strong>Stevie</strong>: <em>Is this the 911 lady I talked to before?</em>
I... Yes, this is Maddie. Stevie, where are you right now?
Uh, I'm not sure.
I'm in a train station. I'm lost.
I need to talk to that police lady that you sent to our house.
I... I can't remember her name.
<em>Sergeant Grant.</em>
Yeah.
<em>She's a friend of mine.</em>
Yeah, I need to talk to her.
I'm getting her on the line, but I need you to try and tell me where you are.
I think we got off on the wrong train.
I-I tried to take us to Dana Point.
We? Is your father with you?
No, no, no, please. You cannot let him find us.
(<em>Phone vibrating</em>)
This is Sergeant Grant.
Athena, it's Maddie. I've got Stevie Parnell on the line.
Stevie called you?
<em>Actually, he was trying to call you. I'll put him on now.</em>
Stevie?
Sorry. I-I should have said something when you came to see me.
I was just so scared.
<strong>Athena</strong>: <em>I know, baby.
<strong>Stevie</strong>: But I really am trying to do the right thing.</em>
Honey, is little Brian with you?
<em>I'm sorry. He lied.</em>
Who did? Who lied?
My dad. He said that Noah's parents didn't want him, and that's why he was gonna be my new brother, but...
I knew it was a lie. I-I tried to say something.
I know you did.
Where's your dad right now?
<em>I'm not sure.</em>
We left while he was asleep.
I was trying to take Noah home but I just got so turned around.
(<em>Phone beeping</em>)
<em>Stevie?</em>
(<em>Phone beeping</em>)
Oh, no. He found us.
Stevie.
Stevie!
Let's go.
Stevie!
Stevie! Stevie!
What station was he calling from?
We pinged him at North Hollywood.
I've alerted metro police and LAPD.
Units have been dispatched.
The next train at that station... Where's it coming from?
<em>Universal City Station.</em>
That's half a mile away.
(<em>Siren wailing</em>)
Very disappointed in you, Stevie.
What if somebody saw... what if your little brother got hurt?
He's not my little brother.
<strong>Officer</strong>: <em>Dispatch, suspect has a weapon.
We've got a hostage situation unfolding here.
<strong>Dispatcher</strong>: All units on scene, general stand-down order in effect.
Do not engage suspect.
Repeat: do not engage suspect.</em>
(<em>Train horn blowing</em>)
And you stay back!
Stay there!
You stay there!
This right here is your stop.
(<em>Grunts</em>)
<strong>Officer</strong>: Grab the knife!
(<em>Shushing</em>)
(<em>Eric groaning</em>)
Don't worry.
You're safe now. I got you.
Do not resist!
I got you both.
Parents are on their way.
He's doing pretty good, all things considered, huh?
Yeah, kids that age are pretty resilient.
He's not the one I'm worried about.
<strong>Romero</strong>: What about his folks? Do they know?
Local PD drove over.
The mother had a panic attack when she saw them.
She thought they were there to make a death notification.
<strong>Romero</strong>: So, what are you gonna tell him?
(<em>Sighs</em>)
He's not my dad, is he?
No. He's not.
Your real father and mother are on their way.
Does she have curly hair?
Your mom?
I used to have this dream when I was little.
There was a house with a big porch and... and a lady.
She had curly hair.
I'd pull on it and she'd laugh.
But my dad...
I mean... Eric...
He... he said it wasn't real.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Your real name is Jacob Daniel Walters.
You were six when he took you.
You were playing outside.
Your mother heard the phone ring.
<em>She was gone less than a minute.
But that's all it took.
Eric stole you in broad daylight.</em>
Oh, my God. Oh!
<em>He drove you hundreds of miles away from home so they could never find you.</em>
(<em>Laughing</em>)
<em>Your parents looked for you for years.
They never gave up.
<strong>Stevie</strong>: They may remember me, but I don't remember them.
Not really.
<strong>Athena</strong>: They're your family.
They love you either way.
And you have the rest of your life ahead of you.
You can make new, happy memories with them.</em>
Hi.
Hi.
(<em>Indistinct chatter</em>)
<strong>Athena</strong>: <em>This is your new beginning.</em>
(<em>Grill sizzling</em>)
Mom! We saw you on TV.
On the news.
(<em>Chuckles</em>) You did?
Saving the day and saving those boys.
<strong>May</strong>: Are they gonna be okay?
They said the older boy had been with that man a long time.
I think so.
I hope so.
He's been through enough.
(<em>Chuckles</em>)
Hell of a job, Sergeant Grant.
Oh. Thank you, Captain.
Okay, looks like we're ready to eat.
Just need a minute.
Tanya Kingston.
I saw you on television with those boys and thought of her.
The men searching the woods for her, all in a line... finding nothing but that barrette.
I never knew why you wanted this job.
Maybe I get it a little more today.
I know you think I don't understand your life.
But you never understood mine, either.
I met a man, fell in love, made a home and raised a beautiful daughter who ran away from us the first chance she got and hasn't stopped running since.
Lately, feels like you and I are rushing, racing to some finish line.
Will I die and leave you first?
Or will I live long enough to discover you've completely turned away from me?
Maybe I was running.
But not away.
This family, this job...
That's what I was running towards.
Mama, I needed to find a place with space big enough where I could build a life that was important to me.
I want you to be a part of that.
But only if you can accept all of it.
Even Bobby.
I love you, baby, but you're making a terrible mistake.
And I worry that the next time your life falls apart, you won't be able to put it back together.
(<em>Phone vibrating</em>)
Donna?
<strong>Donna</strong>: <em>Hey, Maddie, it's me.</em>
Hey. Uh, how did it go?
Did you guys serve Doug with the divorce papers?
<em>No.</em>
Maddie, we can't find him.
(<em>Doorbell buzzes</em>)
Wait, what?
<em>The process server made multiple attempts.
Talked to his neighbors. Nobody's seen Doug for months.</em>
Okay, that doesn't make any sense.
Did you try his work?
<strong>Donna</strong>: <em>He was asked to take some personal time, after he paid your old boss a visit.
He was convinced she knew where you were.
It got physical.</em>
Laurie? Oh, my God. How bad?
<strong>Donna</strong>: <em>She's okay. Security showed up and Doug ran.
But nobody's seen him since.</em>
(<em>Chimney grunting</em>)
It's like a nightmare. Except I never wake up.
<strong>Donna</strong>: <em>I have investigators looking for him.
But be careful, Maddie.</em>
Thanks.
(<em>Sighs</em>) You are not gonna believe this.
Hey, babe.
Doug.
