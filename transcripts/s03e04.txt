The thief is out here.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Thief? I'm sorry.
Uh, dispatch said it was a medical emergency.
<strong>Cynn</strong>: It's both.
(<em>Dramatic musical sting</em>)
Why is this happening?
Divine retribution, Moira.
<strong>Hen</strong>: Hmm, or more likely, it's an allergic reaction.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: All right, ma'am, is there anything in the house that you're sensitive to, medications, foods?
She used to break out in hives when she was stressed.
I'm not stressed?
Our mom just died, so I'm... I'm a little stressed.
Stress wouldn't do this.
Which one of you played bartender?
I did, why?
Phytophotodermatitis, it's a fancy name for margarita burns.
Citrus over a certain temperature and UV light conditions can trigger a chemical reaction.
Ma'am, this ring finger, can you feel it?
No.
<strong>Hen</strong>: An Epi should bring down the swelling, but we're gonna have to cut this ring off.
No! Uh-uh! No! You cannot cut that ring.
That is my ring, and I do not give you authorization to cut it.
Your sister's finger is turning blue.
That's the step before black, when it's dead.
Her whole finger could fall off.
That sounds horrible.
Can't you just cut the finger off now before that happens?
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Ma'am, I understand that it's a sentimental object, so we'll save you the pieces.
I'm gonna give you the shot.
Oh! (<em>Gasps</em>)
<strong>Bobby</strong>: All right, hold still.

I sold it.

Hey, hey, hey.

Come on, aren't you sisters mourning your deceased mother?
Aren't you supposed to be teaching each other empathy instead of setting each other off?

I could see him trying to be strong for his brother and his mother, and it just took me back to when I was a kid trying to be strong for my mother while some doctor explains cancer to us, and it just triggered all these emotions in me.
