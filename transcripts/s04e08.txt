Well, that's exactly what happened this morning after LAPD caught this man breaking into an area home.
Rather than allow himself to be apprehended, he went out a second-story window and fled on foot jumping across rooftops before reaching a literal dead end.
How was I supposed to know this was a cul-de-sac?
I didn't see a sign!
It's okay, Corey.
We all miss the signs now and then.

Shut up! I need to think!
Eh, should've tried thinking before he ended up on a roof.
I mean, he cornered himself.
That there is a whole series of bad life choices culminating in this one unfortunate moment.
It'd be tragic if it wasn't so moronic.
Why don't they just storm the roof?
It's not that high. We can give 'em a ladder.
It's a tactic negotiators use to drag out the process in order to wear down the suspect.
Eventually, they hit a breaking point.
Or we do.
Ten bucks says he falls right off that roof.

I feel like we should use the dining room because the bedroom's gonna be harder to clean.
I can't.
Oh, you're right. You know what?
Wake up, have some coffee. This can wait.
No, I mean I can't do it, this...
having the baby here.

Okay.

You don't know that.
13 minutes, Maddie.
The nearest firehouse is 4 1/2 minutes away.
And then it's into the building and up to the third floor.
Even if they just load and go, it's another five minutes into the ambulance and three to the nearest hospital.
You timed it.
Do you know what can go wrong in 13 minutes?
Because I do. I see it every day.
We lose people in transit.
But I can carry that because that's the job.
But if something was to happen to you or her on my watch, I can't carry, that, Maddie.
That will be the thing that breaks me, so please-- It's okay.
No, it's not.
It's okay 'cause I'm not gonna do that to you.
I love you.
I'm not gonna put you through that.
I love you and this little girl.
And okay, so if the first time that we see her is...
in a delivery room or a parking lot...
It's gonna be the best day of my life.

Buck said the hospital freezer broke.
When?
Last night.
They have a data logger that shows 'em what time it happened, but nobody noticed until, like, 15 minutes ago.
How many vaccines were inside?
Almost 1,000 vials.
They're calling around trying to get people to come in, but there's still 600 doses that have been thawed all morning.
How much time do we have?
Two hours.
Okay.
Let's hit it.
