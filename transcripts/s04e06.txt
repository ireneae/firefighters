Well, is it actually a curse?
I know we called it that, but technically, I think it's a jinx.

I did a good thing.
You also impersonated a firefighter, stole a vehicle, evaded the police, and recklessly endangered the lives of an not-insignificant number of people.
I'm under arrest, huh?
You sure we can't just stay and watch?
You tore up your ticket to this show.
Hey, you-- you must respond to a lot of family emergencies and car accidents and fights.  You probably help a ton of people each and every day.
Don't even think about it.
<i>♪</i> Never been so glad to get to the end of a shift.
And hopefully the end of that jinx.
I mean, that's it, right? Next shift is back to normal?
I might call in sick just in case.
Hey, I know you guys are eager to get the hell out of here, but I'd like to buy you breakfast.
You ever get to that point where you haven't eaten in so long, you stop being hungry?
Yeah, no, me neither.
Still hungry. Let's go.
All right, let's go.
Eddie, you gonna meet us there?
Sorry, guys. I, um, I already have plans.
This guy Brian was never actually a firefighter?
Never. Didn't pass the training.
Well, where'd he get the gear?
Everything he had looked pretty legit.
House 147 was in the debris field of that mudslide.
Been out of commission ever since.

I feel like that's the one part I don't get.
He said he wanted to help people.
So why call in a fake gas leak?
Because he thought it was real.
<i>♪</i> <i>It's a great night at Jim's Burgers.</i> <i>How may I serve you?</i> This is the fire chief of the LAFD.
<i>You're not calling about donations, are you?</i> <i>-Because I don't have-- No, sir.</i> Look, I don't want you to panic, but there's been a report of a gas leak in your building.
Wait, what?
The whole place could go up.
What do I do?
You need to break all the windows immediately.

Here you go.
Thank you. This one's for you.

Here's to the hardest, hungriest working crew I know.
Let's eat.
Oh, my God, I think she's having a heart attack.
Is she all right? Somebody help her.
I'll call it in. Come on, get the LIFEPAK.
On it, Cap.  LAFD.
Okay. Chest, right?
Okay. It's okay.
<i>♪</i> Hey, you made it.
I did.
How's the arm?
Uh, it stings a little, but the doctor said I should be fine and that ice is absolutely the wrong thing to put on it.

That was okay, right? I didn't-- I'm glad you called.

You know, I'm starting to think it turned out pretty good.
Let's get something to eat.
Yes.
Yeah?
Can I get you guys something to drink?
Maybe coffee? No coffee.
Jinx.
