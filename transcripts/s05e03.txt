How is it that every time the world seems to end, it ends some more?
"9-1-1" all new, Mondays.
And watch other Fox shows, like "Our Kind of People," "The Big Leap," and "The Resident" on Fox.
Dispatch, 727-♪-30 at Studio Self-Storage.
I have a possible...
Mr. Hudson.
We were able to extract the bullet from your hip.
The bullet did, however, enter the groin area.
We salvaged what we could.
We placed a stent in your urethra to keep the opening patent.
You'll need a Foley catheter for the next few weeks, but once the sutures are removed and the muscles heal, you should be able to urinate on your own.
Though it will have to be sitting down.
Well, Nurse Miles here will check on your dressing.
<i>Got to hand it to you, Sergeant, when your instincts are right,</i> <i>they are very, very right.</i>  You got him? <i>  We got him, Athena.</i> Jeffery's big adventure is done. He's going back to lockup.
<i>I know some people who are gonna be very happy to hear that.</i> You let them know. I'll take it from here.
I can't believe we just did that.
There it is.
 His home address.
 What for?
Jeffery, we should leave.
And then what?
You made me a murderer.
That's what a crappy lawyer you are.
Instead of getting me off for rape, you're gonna get me hung for murder.
You didn't kill him, I did.
I wasn't talking about him.

Oh, is it?
I got turned around just looking for the little boys' room.
Oh, well, the guest bathroom's over here.
Show me?
Are you from the neighborhood?
I don't think I recognize you.
I'm a friend of your mom's.
 From work?
 Something like that.
So this house party, when did it start?
Like, um, early.
10:00 a. m., people started popping by.
Do you remember the last time you saw your son?
Oh, God. Honestly, I'm not sure.
You need to be sure, Michael.
Yeah, but I'm not, Athena.
What the hell were you thinking?
Just letting strangers just traipse in and out  of our house like that?
 They're not strangers, they're neighbors. Your neighbors.
And I probably wouldn't have, had I known that there was some psycho with a vendetta out for you  who had escaped and was out on the loose!
 Michael, Michael, where were you when the generator died?
The generator did not die. It was unplugged. David said so.
Somebody probably kicked that plug out of the wall.
I was tripping on it all day long.
Nobody tripped over any plug.
Jeffery Hudson was in this house, I know it.
He cut the power and he took our son.
We don't know that for sure. Not yet.
Harry's not at any of the neighbors' houses  that we checked.
 And nobody we spoke to remembers seeing him leaving, by himself or with anyone matching Hudson's description.
We are wasting time. We need to get detectives down here.
And, no offense, I appreciate the help, but my ex-husband's surgeon boyfriend does not need to be the one  out here canvassing.
 All right, I'll see who's available. Excuse me.
Hello? <i> Mom?</i>  Harry?
 Harry, are you okay?
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>  Where are you? <i>  I'm not sure.</i> What do you mean you're not sure?
<i>- He means the whole city's dark.
 Jeffery!</i> <i>You know, I gotta commend you. Somebody raised this boy right.</i> <i>He's been very polite.</i> <i>When I threatened to shoot everyone in your house,</i> <i>he did exactly as I asked.</i> You do not have to do this, Jeffery.
<i>- Don't I?
 No.</i> <i>I feel like I kinda have to do something.</i> <i>I don't think my court case was really going all that well,</i> <i>to be honest, and, well, things have escalated.</i> Things are not nearly as bad  as you think they are. <i>  Really?</i> <i>'Cause they seem pretty bad.</i> You can escape, Jeffery.
Half the state's in the dark.
Our resources are spread razor-thin.
Nobody even knew you were missing for four days.
Nobody has to come looking for you now.
If you can make it to the border, you can just walk into Mexico and be home free.
<i>- Just that easy?
 Yeah.</i> Just let my son go, unharmed, and I promise you I will not come after you.
<i>I'd like to believe that, but</i> <i>I just don't think you have it in you</i> <i>- to give up.
 You're wrong.</i> <i>When you finally realized that I never made it back to lockup,</i> <i>did it occur to you even once to warn your family?</i> <i>No, it did not. Because</i> <i>you weren't thinking about them,</i> <i>you were thinking about me.</i> <i>See, you're not a mom who's a cop.</i> <i>You're a cop who happens to be a mother. So no,</i> <i>this ends one way, my way.</i> <i>You took something from me,</i> <i>now I'm gonna take something from you.</i> Hey, hey.
Thought you were headed home.
Josh said you wanted to see me?
Why don't we sit down.
What's wrong?
It's your brother.
 He's missing. Kidnapped.
 What? Who would...
Jeffery Hudson.
He's in jail.
Well, he's supposed to be, but there was some kind of mix-up.
He's been on the loose since the night the blackout started.
The police just realized the mistake tonight.
But how did Harry...
Hudson showed up at the house.
He took your brother.
I have to go. My parents...
They want you here.
What? I should be with them, helping them find my brother.
I promised your mother that I would keep you here and keep you safe.
 I guess she has enough to worry about.
 Yeah.
Just know that we're doing the best we can.
Yeah, I know. All right.
Well, a BOLO's been issued,  and an Amber Alert.
 That's it?
Nobody's taking this lightly, Michael.
Elaine's pulling what resources she can.
So, but-but where does that leave us?
Elaine wants me to wait here.
And hopefully Jeffery won't be able to resist taunting me, and he'll call again.
That's not much of a plan.
It's all we got.
How about I radio the station and let 'em know  I'm not coming in tonight?
 No.
Go back to work.
I mean, this city can use all the heroes it can get right now.
Okay. I'm a phone call away.
 Love you.
 Love you, too.
 Hey, Bobby. Can you do me a favor?
 Yeah.
Can you drop off David at my place on your way?
Sure.
 Hey, I am so sorry this has happened.
 Yeah.
Yeah, me, too.
Okay what's the plan?
 I just told you the plan.
 Athena, now I was married to you for 17 years.
And there is no way in hell that you are gonna sit here and wait for that phone to ring.
So whatever the next step is, I'm taking it with you.
This is our son. And damn it, you are not leaving me behind this time.
All right.
So what are you thinking?
Well, we know he's using Ransone's car, his gun, and his badge.
So it makes me wonder what else of Ransone's has he been using?
Damn it.
Okay, Harry...
Come on now, buddy. You don't want to do this.
You know I can't leave you out here alone.
It's just not safe.
I'm not fooling around, kid.
I don't have time for this.
I'm gonna give you to the count of five to show yourself.
Then I'm gonna go back and put a bullet in everyone you love.
One.
Two.
Three! Knock it off.
 Help!
 Get in the car.
 Just get in the car.
 Help!
Hey, what are you doing?
It's okay, ma'am, I'm a police officer.
This kid's in my custody.
 Caught him breaking into the building.
 He's lying!
Taking advantage of the blackout, no doubt.
 Help, please. He's gonna kill me. He's not a cop.
 Hey, hey!
 Stop resisting.
 Please.
If you have a phone, record us.
My parents need to know what happened to me.
You said you're a cop.
Where's your badge? Show it to me.
You can't be serious.
You want to see my badge?
Here it is? See?
Okay? I told you, I'm a cop.
It's nothing to worry about, okay?
You and your pooch have a great night, okay?
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i> <i>My friend got shot. We're in the PPZ.</i> <i>- The what?
 The Autonomous Cop-Free Zone.</i> <i>On Santa Monica and Vermont.</i> Dispatch says there's a Gold Line Metro station in the middle of this thing.
 Can't we use that to sneak in?
 I don't sneak.
I don't know who called you guys.
No official passes these barricades.
 We don't need you!
 Get out of here!
 We have volunteers to take care of that.
 But they're not.
Someone in your camp called 911.
That's who we are. We are 911.
You've got a man in there bleeding out.
You have your rules, and we have ours.
 Why is everyone just standing there? They won't let us in.
This wannabe mayor is blocking the way 'cause of some stupid rule. Get the hell out of here!
Really? Since when do anarchists have rules?
 Get out!
 Adapt or die.
There's no rules here.
What are you doing?
You're not supposed to be here.
I'm not supposed to crack your skull open with this either.
Where is the injured guy?
 Help. Over here!
 All right, clear a path.
Gunshot wound. Looks like a through-and-through.
Brachial artery looks to be intact. Chim?
 Got it.
 All right, I'll call it in.
Take some breaths.
So, that was awesome, Cap.
Just not having it tonight, huh?
Everything okay?
Harry's been kidnapped.
 What's the paint for?
 Never mind.
You can't get away, you know.
I know.
Mean old Mommy's gonna come after me, right?
No, actually I was thinking about my dad.
He's gonna beat your ass.
Enough of this crap.
Hands.
Hands, damn it!
So our boy was really charging neighbors five dollars a head?
I hope you told him to give it back.
Yes.
It was enterprising.
God, what if we don't find him?
What if we get to Lou's apartment and there's nothing?
We don't know what we're gonna find, Michael.
 You told Maynard that we're not waiting for them, right?
 Yeah.
She said she'd send whoever she could, but no, I'm not waiting for backup.
I just don't understand it.
I mean, why does this guy hate you so much?
I mean, he could really be in Mexico right now.
Why is he still coming after you?
I shot off his junk.
I'm sorry, you did what, now?
His magic wand. I shot it off.
 No, you did not.
 I did.
 Well, that would do it. Okay.
 It's not funny, Michael.
The hell it's not. I mean, considering what you arrested him for?
I mean, it's poetic.
He was using it as a weapon.
You disarmed the man.
"Hands in the air! Drop it!" I didn't do it on purpose.
But I will say I am not sorry.
All right, we're here.
All right, I guess, uh, this is the part where you tell me that you're the cop, and I'm the architect, and I can't come in there with you.
I wouldn't dare. But I go first.
All right.
Clear.
Bedroom clear.
Is anyone even staying here?
Oh, yeah.
He was here, and he wants me to know it.
Is that a message?
If the middle finger's a message, oh, yeah.
It's a message.
Okay, well, then what else is here?
You know, maybe that's not the only message he left behind.
Maybe there's something else.
You know, a clue to where he took Harry.
Michael, don't touch anything!
What?!
This is a crime scene.
We gotta let 'em go over it.
 We said we wouldn't wait for them.
 We didn't.
But now we gotta let 'em bring in their fine-tooth combs and do their jobs.
This entire room is filled with evidence.
That could lead us to our son.
 Michael. Michael!
 What?!
Do you just want me to stand here and not do anything?
Is that what you're saying to me?
How in the hell am I supposed to do that, Athena?
 He took our son and he's gone!
 Michael, hey. Hey, hey, hey!
Look at me. We're gonna find him.
We're not done. Not yet.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's May.
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
<i>May?</i> <i>Mom, I found Harry.</i> <i>- Help. Help!
 Get in the car.</i> <i>She got it from social media?</i> <i>Yeah. Ever since we had our run-in</i> <i>with your Officer of the Year Reynolds,</i> <i>May gets alerts for videos of cops acting out.</i> <i>Well, I never thought I would say this,</i> <i>but thank God for nosy Karens and their Twitter accounts.</i> Well, our Karen is a Judy, and she lives in Santa Clarita.
 May DM'd her. <i>  Got it. Keep me posted.</i> <i>Detectives are processing Lou's apartment now.</i> <i>- We'll let you know what they find.
 Only a matter of time.</i> Come on. Come on, kid. Come on.
Get in there.
Get in there!
Look, you can scream all you want, kid.
There's no one around to hear.
Listen to me. Hey. Look. I want you to know none of this is your fault. Okay?
It's not mine either. It's hers.
Your mother can save you, or she can come after me.
But she can't do both.
<i>- Help. Help!
 Get in the car.</i> <i>- Hey, what are you doing?
 He's not a cop.</i> <i>He's gonna kill me.</i>  You said this happened three hours ago?
 Yeah.
It took me a really long time to upload the video.
My connection kept dropping out. I almost gave up.
Thank you for doing this.
You know, just to see his face, and to know that he's still fighting, and that he's still alive...
Now, tell me, what did you see before the video?
I mean, was he hurting Harry?
They were struggling. The guy was trying to get him back into the car.
I knew that something was wrong, but then he showed me his badge.
And you pulled out your phone.
That was your son's idea.
 He's a really smart kid.
 Yeah.
 You guys did a great job.
 Thank you.
You hear that, babe?
Is that your wife?
Ex-wife.
<i>Okay, I'm on the freeway.</i> Where am I going? <i> Hey, slow down.</i> <i>We're gonna get to that in a minute.</i> <i>First, the ground rules.</i> Come alone, no backup. I get it, don't worry.
<i>Oh, I'm not worried, but you should be.</i> <i>Because where we're going, there are no police allowed.</i> The autonomous zone?
I'll see you here, Sergeant Grant.
What's he doing? He still hasn't moved.
Leave it alone, Buck. Nobody's going in there.
I can't imagine what Cap's going through right now.
If it was Christopher, I'd be losing my mind.
Why Harry? Thought this guy's thing was attacking women.
Pretty sure that's exactly what he's doing, Buck.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women.
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
Hail Mary...
Michael.
<i>Bobby, we've got an emergency.</i> Nice night for a walk.
You lost?
I believe I'm home.
They said this is the People's Protection Zone?
Well, I'm people.
And you need protection?
Actually, I do.
 From who?
 An animal with a badge.
You're in the right place.
What's this pig look like?
<i>See? I'm a cop.</i>  Maybe you can share this with your people? <i>- Okay?</i> <i>Here it is.</i> I'm here, alone. Just like I said.
 Where's my son? <i>Don't you worry about that</i> <i>right now.</i> You may have brought me down here to put a bullet in me, but I'm not gonna give you that chance.
Not till you tell me where my son is.
<i>Hey, you are not the one calling the shots here,</i> <i>Sergeant Grant, I am.</i> <i>So what, you gonna pick me off from the shadows?</i> Is that your plan, Jeffery?
What about all these innocent civilians?
<i>Innocent?</i> Really? They've commandeered eight city blocks.
They're hardly innocent. They're thieves.
Well, whatever they are, I don't think they'll take too kindly to a dirty cop killing someone in the middle of their People's Paradise.
You got yourself an exit strategy worked out?
Oh, I've got everything worked out.
 Yeah, I bet you do.
 And when you say "dirty cop," are you referring to me or to you?
<i>I'm not dirty.</i> <i>And I'm not a cop.</i> <i>Really? 'Cause that's not what I hear</i> <i>you been telling folk.</i> <i>See? I'm a cop.</i> There he is.
That guy's a cop!
That's him, right there!
That guy's a cop!
 Thank you for your help. Keep everyone up here.
 What are you gonna do?
 I'm going after him.
 Are you crazy? That guy's a cop.
 They're all animals.
 I beg to differ.
Jeffery, this doesn't have to end badly.
You show yourself now and prove to me that my son is safe, and my offer still holds.
I'll let you walk out of here.
You don't believe me?
Lou Ransone told me that it wasn't you who attacked him.
He said it was Lila Risco.
You hear me, Jeffery?
Detective Ransone isn't dead.
He survived. But you didn't know that, did you?
Otherwise you wouldn't have been squatting in his apartment.
And as for the lady lawyer, well, I figure, after seeing what she was capable of, that was just self-defense.
I know things seem dark right now and hopeless, but they're not hopeless.
And they're most definitely not dark!
Drop the gun, Jeffery.
Wow.
You lured me down here.
No, bitch, I chased you down here.
Now drop it, and tell me where my boy's at.
 How'd you even manage to pull this off?
 Easy.
I got no end of backup.
<i>You think you got me alone that night? No, sir.</i> <i>When you came at me, you came at everyone who loves me.</i> You didn't stand a chance.
And you got lucky that night.
If you hadn't picked up that gun, you'd be <i>dead</i> already!
And you'd still be peeing standing up.
Now drop it!
Don't make me shoot you again.
No?
That your firefighter husband?
Damn it!
 It wasn't loaded.
 What?
Where's Harry?
Tell me where he is!
Keep him alive. Keep him alive!
He's not breathing.
Where is he? Where is he?!
Where is he?! Where is he?!
Tell me where he is!
I got no pulse.
Jeffery Hudson was an evil man, but he wasn't a stupid one.
He knew that this could only end one way.
He made sure it happened on his terms.
He knew exactly what he was doing, what he was making me do.
He was our last lead to finding Harry, and I-I played right into his hands.
You sent that man where he belongs; Straight to hell.
 It...
 No, listen.
That guy has no more moves.
It's up to us to find our son, and he's alive.
We have to believe that.
So this is everything we found on his body?
And from Ransone's car, yes.
What do these keys belong to?
 No idea. The answer is in those four days before we knew Hudson was missing. I think he was planning something.
Is there any way we can trace the movements of this phone?
It's a burner.
All right.
All right, so we know the video of Harry was made in Santa Clarita.
What was he doing there? Where was he going?
There was a report that the real estate office that Hudson worked out of was broken into a few days ago.
But several of the businesses out there  were also hit by looters.
 You think looters would hit a real estate office?
Did they happen to report any keys missing?
We need to find out if that real estate office has any listings in or around Santa Clarita.
<i>Not Santa Clarita. Next door. Valencia.</i> A housing development his company was refurbishing.
They never finished the project.
<i>It shut down because of the pandemic.</i> <i>It's been sitting empty ever since.</i> Thanks, baby.
Valencia. Bring those damn keys.
Who you calling?
Reinforcements.
 I'll send units.
 You do that.
Hey, I-I have keys.
We don't need keys.
All right. I want every one of these houses checked.
Every room. Every closet, crawl space, basement.
Every inch. Let's go!
Harry!
 Harry!
 Harry?
 Eddie...
 Yeah?
Harry!
 Harry.
 Harry?
Come on, Harry. You up here?
 Harry!
 Harry!
 Harry?
 Harry?
Harry!
 Harry!
 Harry!
Harry?
Harry!
Cap. Nothing upstairs, nothing in the crawl spaces.
The other houses are clear, too.
We can pull the FLIR tech. Or maybe  we can get some dogs out here.
 Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, or maybe this is a goose chase, and he's buried  out there somewhere.
 Michael!
Hey, I found this out back.
I don't know if it means anything.
Check for wet paint, guys.
Wet paint.
 Eddie.
 On it.
Wait, wait, wait! Harry!
Harry! All right, guys.
 Come on!
 Get a gurney in here!
 Athena, we got him! Hey, give me a knife or something!
Oh, come on.
 We got him, we got him, baby.
 Come on! Come on!
 Come on.
 I got him, I got him.
Okay, take it easy.
 We got you. We got you.
 Is he okay?
Pulse is weak.
 Get him out of here!
 Get him out, get him out.
We got you. We're gonna take care of you, okay?
 Make a hole! Make a hole!
 You okay?
Okay.
Okay, vitals are good. Everything seems good.
Mommy, did you get him?
Yeah, I got him, baby.
And now we got you, too.
Everything's okay now.
Everything's just fine.
Do you hear that?
Oh...AC! How I missed you.
The power's on, and not a moment too soon.
My leg was really not up for taking those stairs again.
Everything okay?
 It's from my brother.
 Oh...
 Oh, honey.
 Good.
<i>Violence and further property damage</i> <i>continue to ravage the area that has been called</i> <i>an autonomous zone...</i> <i>Hey, it's Chimney. Talk later.</i> Hi. Uh, I know that you're working, but something...
You know what, never mind.
We're good here.
I just wanted to make sure you're okay, too.
Love you.
Well, look at all of this glorious electricity.
Guess the power czar is out of business.
I gladly hand my power back to the power company.
Good, 'cause my phone is dead. You did a horrible job.
How's Harry doing?
As good as can be after being abducted by a lunatic and sealed in a wall to die.
Did Cap not come back with you?
He's still at the hospital with Athena.
Uh, so who's in charge till he gets back?
I am.
He did not say that.
Not in words.
You didn't catch that manly glance of unspoken confidence he flashed me before we left?
I did not.
He said that if he wasn't back by end of shift, that he would close it out in the morning.
Would you guys say this is the longest shift we've ever worked?
It definitely rates.
Harry's okay?
Oh, he's...he's safe.
 How are you?
 Ask me tomorrow.
It is tomorrow.
Then I'm good.
<i>- You're finally coming home?
 Yes.</i> And I cannot wait to see you.
Ah. Thought you'd be the first one out the door.
Christopher know you're coming?
Not yet.
I haven't figured out what I'm gonna say when I get home.
To Ana.
<i>since the five-day citywide blackout has ended.</i> <i>Thankfully, the power grid has returned to normal function.</i> <i>Utilities and essential technologies</i> <i>- have followed suit.
 Hi, honey.</i> I'm home.
<i>The hacker group initially claiming responsibility,</i> <i>and demanding a hefty ransom, has gone off-line,</i> <i>virtually scrubbing their existence from the Internet,</i> <i>leaving no trace...</i> Are you sure you don't want to go to bed, man?
I know you're exhausted.
I'm not tired.
<i>a very trying week. Many questions remain...</i> Now, you know you can talk to me, right?
There's nothing to talk about. I'm fine.
<i>But now that the power has at least been restored,</i> <i>Angelinos can begin to put their lives back together,</i> <i>piece by piece.</i> Okay, I think that is everything.
You ready to go see your daddy?
Yeah, I think he's gonna be happy to see you, too.
Mmm. You know, I thought that I would hate canned fruit, but it's not bad.
A little lime, some chili. Who'd have thought?
Yes!
It is all good.
Great, actually.
You didn't have to cook all this, though.
Let's make brownies next.
You know, I think we need to clean that kitchen first.
Maybe you should go home first.
I mean, you've been stuck here for days.
I'm sure you want to get back to your own place.
Have some time for yourself.
Right. Yeah.
But I am not going to leave you with the disaster in the kitchen.
A disaster.
I'm sorry. I know this place is such a wreck.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, but you've been working nonstop, so, you shouldn't have to come home to this mess...
Oh, I-I bet the dishwasher is working now, right?
You know what, I don't know what I miss more, whether it's the dishwasher or the refrigerator.
 Ana...
 Or the air conditioning.
It's probably the-the air conditioning, definitely.
Ana. Ana, stop.
We need to talk.
Those four words.
Maybe we should sit down.
Why?
You're fine.
You're not gonna pass out or anything, right?
Your heart rate is not going up?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
I don't want you to...to panic when you think about me.
Or when you think about a future with me.
I can't...I can't take that.
I thought it would work.
I did. The idea of us.
Chris loves you so much.
I just thought...
That eventually you would, too?
 I should have said something sooner.
 Yeah.
You probably should have.
Well, I'm sorry about the mess, but I guess it's...it's your mess now.
 Right?
 Yeah, I guess it is.
You're...
You're an amazing father.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go say goodbye to him.
Adios.
Hey, Christopher.
Oh...
Is it ironic that all I want to do is close the blackout curtains and go to sleep?
Maddie.
Maddie?
Hey, what's up, Cap?
Ravi, what are you still doing here?
I was waiting for Cap to get back.
Yeah, he just called me in. Where is he?
Upstairs.
Hey, Cap, what's going on?
What couldn't you tell me over the...
Jee-Yun. What's my daughter doing here?
When I came back to wrap the shift, she was here.
 Maddie was here?
 Not Maddie.
The baby.
Her mother dropped her off.
What, with you?
I was the only one here.
I don't understand. Where's Maddie?
She's not here, Chim.
She asked me to give you this.
<i>Hi.</i> <i>I'm sure that you are confused,</i> <i>hurt, and, uh</i> <i>probably really scared.</i> <i>I don't know what to say.</i> <i>You don't need to go to the police</i> <i>or come looking for me.</i> <i>I'm not in any danger,</i> <i>and no one is making me do this.</i> <i>But Jee is not safe with me.</i> <i>Not now, and maybe...</i> I know that you're gonna take really good care of her.
And she's better off without me.
I love you.
<i>I love both of you.</i> <i>And I'm really sorry.</i>
