Mr. Hudson.
We were able to extract the bullet from your hip.
The bullet did, however, enter the groin area.
We salvaged what we could.
We placed a stent in your urethra to keep the opening patent.
You'll need a Foley catheter for the next few weeks, but once the sutures are removed and the muscles heal, you should be able to urinate on your own.
Though it will have to be sitting down.
Well, Nurse Miles here will check on your dressing.

<strong>Ransone</strong>: <em>Got to hand it to you, Sergeant, when your instincts are right, they are very, very right.</em>
You got him?

Jeffery's big adventure is done. He's going back to lockup.
<em>I know some people who are gonna be very happy to hear that.</em>
You let them know. I'll take it from here.

Instead of getting me off for rape, you're gonna get me hung for murder.

This is my mom's room.
Oh, is it?
(<em>music playing faintly</em>)
I got turned around just looking for the little boys' room.
Oh, well, the guest bathroom's over here.
Show me?
Are you from the neighborhood?
I don't think I recognize you.
I'm a friend of your mom's.
From work?
Something like that.
So this house party, when did it start?
Like, um, early.
10:00 a.m., people started popping by.
Do you remember the last time you saw your son?
Oh, God. Honestly, I'm not sure.
You need to be sure, Michael.
Yeah, but I'm not, Athena.
What the hell were you thinking?
Just letting strangers just traipse in and out of our house like that?
They're not strangers, they're neighbors. Your neighbors.
And I probably wouldn't have, had I known that there was some psycho with a vendetta out for you who had escaped and was out on the loose!
Michael, Michael, where were you when the generator died?
The generator did not die. It was unplugged. David said so.
Somebody probably kicked that plug out of the wall.
I was tripping on it all day long.
Nobody tripped over any plug.
Jeffery Hudson was in this house, I know it.
He cut the power and he took our son.
<strong>Maynard</strong>: We don't know that for sure. Not yet.
Harry's not at any of the neighbors' houses that we checked.
And nobody we spoke to remembers seeing him leaving, by himself or with anyone matching Hudson's description.
We are wasting time. We need to get detectives down here.
And, no offense, I appreciate the help, but my ex-husband's surgeon boyfriend does not need to be the one out here canvassing.
All right, I'll see who's available. Excuse me.
(<em>phone ringing, vibrating</em>)
Hello?
<strong>Harry</strong>: <em>Mom?</em>
Harry?
Harry, are you okay?
<em>Yeah, I'm okay.</em>
Where are you?
<em>I'm not sure.</em>
What do you mean you're not sure?
(<em>Harry cries out</em>)
<strong>Jeffery</strong>: <em>He means the whole city's dark.</em>
Jeffery!
<em>You know, I gotta commend you. Somebody raised this boy right. He's been very polite. When I threatened to shoot everyone in your house, he did exactly as I asked.</em>
You do not have to do this, Jeffery.
<em>Don't I?</em>
No.
<em>I feel like I kinda have to do something. I don't think my court case was really going all that well, to be honest, and, well, things have escalated.</em>
Things are not nearly as bad as you think they are.
<em>Really? 'Cause they seem pretty bad.</em>
You can escape, Jeffery.
Half the state's in the dark.
Our resources are spread razor-thin.
Nobody even knew you were missing for four days.
Nobody has to come looking for you now.
If you can make it to the border, you can just walk into Mexico and be home free.
<em>Just that easy?</em>
Yeah.
Just let my son go, unharmed, and I promise you I will not come after you.
<em>I'd like to believe that, but I just don't think you have it in you to give up.</em>
You're wrong.
<em>When you finally realized that I never made it back to lockup, did it occur to you even once to warn your family? No, it did not. Because you weren't thinking about them, you were thinking about me. See, you're not a mom who's a cop. You're a cop who happens to be a mother. So no, this ends one way, my way. You took something from me, now I'm gonna take something from you.</em>
(<em>line beeps</em>)
Hey, hey.
(<em>sirens wailing</em>)
Thought you were headed home.
Josh said you wanted to see me?
Why don't we sit down.
What's wrong?
It's your brother.
He's missing. Kidnapped.
What? Who would...
Jeffery Hudson.
He's in jail.
Well, he's supposed to be, but there was some kind of mix-up.
He's been on the loose since the night the blackout started.
The police just realized the mistake tonight.
But how did Harry...
Hudson showed up at the house.
He took your brother.
I have to go. My parents...
They want you here.
What? I should be with them, helping them find my brother.
I promised your mother that I would keep you here and keep you safe.
(<em>sighs</em>)
I guess she has enough to worry about.
Yeah.
Just know that we're doing the best we can.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Yeah, I know. All right.
Well, a BOLO's been issued, and an Amber Alert.
That's it?
Nobody's taking this lightly, Michael.
Elaine's pulling what resources she can.
So, but-but where does that leave us?
Elaine wants me to wait here.
And hopefully Jeffery won't be able to resist taunting me, and he'll call again.
That's not much of a plan.
It's all we got.
How about I radio the station and let 'em know I'm not coming in tonight?
No.
Go back to work.
I mean, this city can use all the heroes it can get right now.
Okay. I'm a phone call away.
Love you.
Love you, too.
Hey, Bobby. Can you do me a favor?
Yeah.
Can you drop off David at my place on your way?
Sure.
Hey, I am so sorry this has happened.
Yeah.
Yeah, me, too.
Okay... what's the plan?
I just told you the plan.
Athena, now I was married to you for 17 years.
And there is no way in hell that you are gonna sit here and wait for that phone to ring.
So whatever the next step is, I'm taking it with you.
This is our son. And damn it, you are not leaving me behind this time.
All right.
So what are you thinking?
Well, we know he's using Ransone's car, his gun, and his badge.
So it makes me wonder what else of Ransone's has he been using?
(<em>brakes screech</em>)
(<em>door opens, closes</em>)
Damn it.
Okay, Harry...
Come on now, buddy. You don't want to do this.
You know I can't leave you out here alone.
It's just not safe.
I'm not fooling around, kid.
I don't have time for this.
I'm gonna give you to the count of five to show yourself.
Then I'm gonna go back and put a bullet in everyone you love.
One.
Two.
Three! Knock it off.
Help!
Get in the car.
Just get in the car.
Help!
Hey, what are you doing?
It's okay, ma'am, I'm a police officer.
This kid's in my custody.
Caught him breaking into the building.
He's lying!
Taking advantage of the blackout, no doubt.
Help, please. He's gonna kill me. He's not a cop.
Hey, hey!
Stop resisting.
Please.
If you have a phone, record us.
My parents need to know what happened to me.
You said you're a cop.
Where's your badge? Show it to me.
You can't be serious.
You want to see my badge?
Here it is? See?
Okay? I told you, I'm a cop.
It's nothing to worry about, okay?
You and your pooch have a great night, okay?

Dispatch says there's a Gold Line Metro station in the middle of this thing.
Can't we use that to sneak in?
I don't sneak.

No official passes these barricades.

I'm not supposed to crack your skull open with this either.
Where is the injured guy?
Help. Over here!

Gunshot wound. Looks like a through-and-through.
Brachial artery looks to be intact. Chim?
Got it.
All right, I'll call it in.

Everything okay?
Harry's been kidnapped.

Never mind.
You can't get away, you know.

Mean old Mommy's gonna come after me, right?
No, actually I was thinking about my dad.
He's gonna beat your ass.
Enough of this crap.

(<em>muffled cry</em>)
So our boy was really charging neighbors five dollars a head?
I hope you told him to give it back.
Yes.
It was enterprising.
God, what if we don't find him?
What if we get to Lou's apartment and there's nothing?
We don't know what we're gonna find, Michael.
You told Maynard that we're not waiting for them, right?
Yeah.
She said she'd send whoever she could, but no, I'm not waiting for backup.
I just don't understand it.
I mean, why does this guy hate you so much?
I mean, he could really be in Mexico right now.
Why is he still coming after you?
I shot off his junk.
I'm sorry, you did what, now?
His magic wand. I shot it off.
No, you did not.
I did.
(<em>laughing</em>)
Well, that would do it. Okay.
It's not funny, Michael.
The hell it's not. I mean, considering what you arrested him for?
I mean, it's poetic.
He was using it as a weapon.
You disarmed the man.
&quot;Hands in the air! Drop it!&quot;
(<em>both laugh</em>)
I didn't do it on purpose.
But I will say I am not sorry.
All right, we're here.
All right, I guess, uh, this is the part where you tell me that you're the cop, and I'm the architect, and I can't come in there with you.
I wouldn't dare. But I go first.
All right.
Clear.
Bedroom clear.
Is anyone even staying here?
Oh, yeah.
He was here, and he wants me to know it.
Is that a message?
If the middle finger's a message, oh, yeah.
It's a message.
Okay, well, then what else is here?
You know, maybe that's not the only message he left behind.
Maybe there's something else.
You know, a clue to where he took Harry.
Michael, don't touch anything!
What?!
This is a crime scene.
We gotta let 'em go over it.
We said we wouldn't wait for them.
We didn't.
But now we gotta let 'em bring in their fine-tooth combs and do their jobs.
This entire room is filled with evidence.
That could lead us to our son.
Michael. Michael!
What?!
Do you just want me to stand here and not do anything?
Is that what you're saying to me?
How in the hell am I supposed to do that, Athena?
He took our son and he's gone!
Michael, hey. Hey, hey, hey!
Look at me. We're gonna find him.
We're not done. Not yet.

<strong>Maynard</strong>: <em>Well, I never thought I would say this, but thank God for nosy Karens and their Twitter accounts.</em>
Well, our Karen is a Judy, and she lives in Santa Clarita.
May DM'd her.
<em>Got it. Keep me posted. Detectives are processing Lou's apartment now. We'll let you know what they find.</em>

Your mother can save you, or she can come after me.
But she can't do both.

Get in the car.
Hey, what are you doing?</em>

You said this happened three hours ago?
Yeah.
It took me a really long time to upload the video.
My connection kept dropping out. I almost gave up.
Thank you for doing this.
You know, just to see his face, and to know that he's still fighting... and that he's still alive...
Now, tell me, what did you see before the video?
I mean, was he hurting Harry?
They were struggling. The guy was trying to get him back into the car.
I knew that something was wrong, but then he showed me his badge.
And you pulled out your phone.
That was your son's idea.
He's a really smart kid.
Yeah. (<em>chuckles</em>)

Thank you.

<strong>Taylor</strong>: <em>But now that the power has at least been restored, Angelinos can begin to put their lives back together, piece by piece.</em>
Okay, I think that is everything.
You ready to go see your daddy?
Yeah, I think he's gonna be happy to see you, too.
Mmm. You know, I thought that I would hate canned fruit, but it's not bad.
A little lime, some chili. Who'd have thought?
Yes!
It is all good.
Great, actually.
You didn't have to cook all this, though.
Let's make brownies next.
(<em>laughs</em>)
You know, I think we need to clean that kitchen first.
Maybe you should go home first.
I mean, you've been stuck here for days.
I'm sure you want to get back to your own place.
Have some time for yourself.
Right. Yeah.
But I am not going to leave you with the disaster in the kitchen.
(<em>clears throat</em>)
A disaster. (<em>laughs</em>)
I'm sorry. I know this place is such a wreck.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, but you've been working nonstop, so, you shouldn't have to come home to this mess...
Oh, I-I bet the dishwasher is working now, right?
You know what, I don't know what I miss more, whether it's the dishwasher or the refrigerator.
Ana...
Or the air conditioning.
It's probably the-the air conditioning, definitely.
Ana. Ana, stop.
We need to talk.
Those four words.
Maybe we should sit down.
Why?
You're fine.
You're not gonna pass out or anything, right?
Your heart rate is not going up?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
I don't want you to... to panic when you think about me.
Or when you think about a future with me.
I can't... I can't take that.
I thought it would work.
I did. The idea of us.
Chris loves you so much.
I just thought...
That eventually you would, too?
I should have said something sooner.
Yeah.
You probably should have.
Well, I'm... sorry about the mess, but I guess it's... it's your mess now.
Right?
Yeah, I guess it is.
You're...
You're an amazing father.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go say goodbye to him.
Adios.
(<em>speaks spanish</em>)
(<em>chuckles</em>) Hey, Christopher.
Oh...
Is it ironic that all I want to do is close the blackout curtains and go to sleep?
Maddie.
Maddie?
(<em>phone vibrating</em>)
Hey, what's up, Cap?
Ravi, what are you still doing here?
I was waiting for Cap to get back.
Yeah, he just called me in. Where is he?
Upstairs.
Hey, Cap, what's going on?
What couldn't you tell me over the...
(<em>Jee-yun fussing</em>)
Jee-Yun. What's my daughter doing here?
When I came back to wrap the shift, she was here.
Maddie was here?
Not Maddie.
The baby.
Her mother dropped her off.
What, with you?
I was the only one here.
I don't understand. Where's Maddie?
She's not here, Chim.
She asked me to give you this.
<em>Hi. I'm sure that you are confused, hurt, and, uh... probably really scared. I don't know what to say. You don't need to go to the police or come looking for me. I'm not in any danger, and no one is making me do this. But Jee is not safe with me. Not now, and maybe...</em>
I know that you're gonna take really good care of her.
And she's better off without me.
I love you.
<em>I love both of you. And I'm really sorry.</em>
