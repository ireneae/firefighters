What? No.
Any silver-based eye drops?
<strong>Lorna</strong>: No, no.
Nose sprays?
<strong>Lorna</strong>: No.
Any medications we should know about?
Benzocaine. Toothache gel.
She used the whole thing.
And a trash can full of empties.
She's seizing.
(<em>Lorna grunting</em>)
Okay.
Got her?
I got her.
Could be Methemoglobinemia.
Okay, put her on the CO-oximeter.
♪ ♪
Methemoglobin levels are 60%.
61. Climbing.
Anything over 70 can be deadly.
Hen, get her on 02. Run a fluid line.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: I'll grab the methylene blue chloride.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: It's the benzocaine.
Overuse can prevent the body from releasing red blood cells.
♪ ♪
Uh, why is she bleeding chocolate syrup?
Because, blood thinner boy, Methemoglobinemia causes her blood to appear much darker than normal, which then causes her skin to only reflect blue light, hence, the Smurf lady.
Methylene blue converts the ferric iron into ferrous iron and turns the blood back to red.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: I've never seen a case this advanced, Hen.
Let's give her two doses.
♪ ♪
Methemogblin levels dropping.
Skin color's turning back to normal.
Oh, my God.
I'm...
I'm not blue!
Ouch. But my teeth.
How am I gonna get through work?
Well, good news.
You earned yourself a day off.
And a morphine drip.
Look further, come on back!
Three feet. Two feet.

We're good.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Yes. Yes, you are, Captain.
Merry Christmas.
Athena, what are you doing here?

Someone said you were ordering takeout for Christmas dinner.
I did vote for turkey. (<em>Laughs</em>)

Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Eddie.
<strong>Both</strong>: Merry Christmas.
Can't believe you did this.
Thank you, Buck.
Well, you inspired me.
You know, I figured we should all get to immerse ourselves in the magic of Christmas.
Aww, this is a great surprise.
Merry Christmas.
That's not the only one.
Denny and I brought a few gifts for dinner.
The social worker said that he had to stay at a group home during the holidays.
Yeah. She did.
So I convinced the social worker to let me bring the group home here.
Apparently, there's a serious overcrowding problem.
Not enough foster parents to go around.
This is gonna sound crazy, but... maybe we should consider...
We have an appointment with a social worker on January 3rd.
There's more than one way to help a family, right?
(<em>Laughs</em>)
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Maddie.
<strong>Maddie</strong>: Sorry we're late.
You know hospitals and red tape.
You're one of the paramedics that saved me.
Thank you.
It was my pleasure.
Though I can't believe you got them to spring you already.
Well, they were sending me home tomorrow anyway.
I wasn't gonna miss Christmas with my boy.
<strong>Leo</strong>: Mom! Mom!
You're here!
Hey.
Come on. Let's go.
Thanks.
So how'd it go?
(<em>Stirring music</em>)
It wasn't easy... but I'm really glad I did it, and I finally feel... free.
All right, let's eat before the bell rings.
Shall we?
Yeah.
Let's eat.
Come on.
We are grateful for this food, and we are grateful to have each other.
Amen.
All right, let's dig in.

Oh, yeah?

Buck, thanks for helping me with this.
I think your New Year's resolution should be to use that head for good instead of evil.
I will definitely put that at the top of my list.
(<em>Laughs</em>)
I will be right back.
How you feeling?
Man, I'm doing great.
Yeah, this is a nice Christmas.
(<em>Dramatic music</em>)
You know they mean the world to me.
And you to them.
I think we are pretty damn lucky to have all found each other.
What's going on, Michael?

When I fell, uh... you know, they did some scans.
They found a mass, Bobby.
Headaches, the fall, ending up in the wrong bed.

It's a tumor.
