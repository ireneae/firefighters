<strong>Abby</strong>: People are resilient.
I think we're designed that way.
It's embedded in our DNA to forge ahead, soldier on.
It's a whole lot easier to do with an army at your back.
( <em>Siren whoops</em> )
<strong>Officer ( <em>over P.A.</em> )</strong>: Got to keep moving, brother.
Can't sleep here. Keep moving.
<strong>Abby</strong>: But sometimes it feels like we're on our own.
♪ It seems like I'm caught up in your trap again... ♪
It might even feel like the world is conspiring against us at times.

How do you get out? How do you break the cycle?

Wait! No! No!

( <em>Emergency horn honking</em> )
What's this dude's problem?
Seriously? He doesn't hear us?
We're gonna have to get in front of him.
Okay.
( <em>Tires screech</em> )
What the hell, guys?
You got a guy trapped inside, inside the compactor.
That's impossible.
He dialed 911 from inside.
No, I mean that's not possible.
We haven't picked any garbage up yet.
Wait, what?
You got the wrong truck, man. She's empty.
What's going on?
It's the wrong truck.
Um, thank you. Carry on. Y-You're doing a great job.
Dispatch, this is T-118. We are at Chandler and Allott.
We have the wrong garbage truck.
Do you have a location for the garbage truck?
<strong>Athena</strong>: This is 727-L-30.
I got eyes on your garbage truck.
Corner of Ventura and Stern. Search and Rescue on the way.
That's, like, two blocks away.
Let's go.
All right.
( <em>Siren wailing</em> )
( <em>Screaming</em> )
<strong>Man</strong>: Help!
Turn it off!
Help!
Turn off the compactor now!
( <em>Siren wailing</em> )
Turn off the compactor!
Help!
There's someone inside.
What?!
The Dumpster. He was asleep.
How was I supposed to know he was sleeping in one of the Dumpsters?
You're not in any trouble.
Did you run the compactor?
Yeah.
What kind of pressure does it operate under?
I don't know. 2,000 PSI? Maybe more?
That would crush a car.
<strong>Garbageman</strong>: Damn. Look at her go.
Hello? Is anybody down there?
Can you hear us?
Ooh, this stinks.
People call us heroes?
( <em>Grunts</em> )
<strong>Buck</strong>: Oh, Hen, hold up.
It's gonna take forever by hand.
Hey, Chim, can you grab shovels?
Come on, what are you, scared to get your hands dirty, Buck?
Come on, let's go!
What's with her?
I don't know.
But if I were you, I'd stay out of her way.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: I'm coming in.
You got that.
<strong>Garbageman</strong>: Wait, so, he was, uh, he was sleeping in a Dumpster, but he has a cell phone?
They give them to the homeless.
It's part of the Lifeline program.
Keeps them connected to family, if they have any.
( <em>Grunts</em> )
I got him. I see a foot!
( <em>Hen grunting</em> )
I got it.
I got a pulse.
Stay still, sir. Do not move your neck.
Chim, get me a neck brace and a board in here.
We got to get him out of here.
I don't understand.
How'd he survive that kind of pressure?
Probably fell into this pocket here.
He got protected by the chair.
Sir, can you hear me?
Can you hear me? Does it hurt when you breathe?
It hurts.
I can't feel my legs.
Well, don't worry, okay?
We're gonna get you out of there.
You're gonna be all right, okay?
What's your name?
Sam.
You're gonna be all right, Sam.
( <em>Onlookers cheering</em> )
<strong>Abby</strong>: So, Carla, it's your last chance to tell me if you're not up for working extra hours.
( <em>Chuckles</em> ) When have you ever known me not to speak my mind?
( <em>Laughs</em> ) Very true.
Well, I appreciate it.
Mm-hmm.
Buck and I are both working the graveyard shift, and then he has a little breakfast date planned for us.
Ooh.
And considering our last proper date was scheduled when you and I
( <em>Whispers</em> ): were in the E.R. with her.
Uh-huh.
Well, have fun, all right. I could use the overtime.
Okay, good. Good.
( <em>Laughs</em> )
Hope this date is him having you rub baby oil on his biceps.
( <em>Both laugh</em> )
Okay, Mom.
I got to go to work.
Stay.
Mom.
Stay, please.
I know. I wish I could.
Stay. Stay.
Can you let go of me, Mom?
Please.
It's okay. I'll see you in the morning, okay?
Are you okay?
Come on. Come on.
Oh, my God.
Do you... do you need some ice?
( <em>Abby crying softly</em> )
I'm good. I mean...
( <em>Sighs</em> ) She's getting worse.
Maybe it...
This could be another episode.
( <em>Sighs</em> ) Oh, God.
What the...?
It's okay.
I should stay. I'm not...
No. No.
No, no, no. Get out of here.
No, I mean, this is...
Go to work. Go to your date. Go be young while you still are.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah. Okay.
Oh, my God. ( <em>Sniffles</em> )
I didn't ask you to lunch just so I can buy you a hot dog you won't eat.
Talk to me.
Is this about Karen? Did you tell her?
I didn't have to.
She already knew.
And she presented me with papers.
Oh, a divorce?
Custody.
My ex is suing us for custody.
On what grounds?
'Cause she's the birth mother.
And that she gave up the baby under duress.
Does she have a chance?
Well, I read about a case in Michigan where they took a five-year-old little boy away from the only family he ever knew and gave him to his birth father.
I mean, her chances are slim, but they're not zero.
And now she's saying that... that Denny's living in an unstable home because... because I stepped out on my wife.
With the same damn woman who's suing you for custody?
All I know is that I just feel like... covering myself in all that garbage we just dug through and letting the compactor just squish me into nothing.
You gonna get through this.
And I'm here to help.
I mean, if you need the number of a good lawyer...
( <em>Laughs</em> ) Divorce or custody?
Between my wife and my ex, I don't know who I'm-a face in court first.
You know, my recommendation for you will be make divorce the last option.
It's hard work, especially if you have kids.
You and Michael... y'all gonna get a divorce?
It's time.
I mean, I'm not sad about...
I am, but I know it's the right thing.
Mm-hmm.
And I feel excited about the future, you know, about not feeling so confused all the time. ( <em>Chuckles</em> )
You finding anyone new?
( <em>Laughs</em> ) Dang, girl, already?
What? ( <em>Laughs</em> ) Get out of here with that.
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
I'm still trapped in my past.
You just got free. You gonna tell me about this.
The other night, I met a guy at a bar.
Wow.
Athena Grant let a stranger pick her up and take her home?
Oh, I did a background check.
Yeah, no.
My plan wasn't to go home with him, but he was just...
( <em>Sighs</em> )
Needed to feel like a woman.
Mm.
I left there thinking that, you know... that's a one-hit wonder.
But?
Guess I made an impression.
Round two's on the books?
Tomorrow right after my shift.
Oh!
( <em>Both laughing</em> )
We're late. Again.
Dr. Franks doesn't care.
Because Dr. Franks gets to charge us for the whole session, no matter how much of it we miss.
Maybe it's not worth it, okay?
I don't think Dr. Franks is really doing any good.
Because you are not trying.
Trying what?
( <em>Elevator bell dings</em> )
To grow up. To be an adult.
You're 18, not eight. You don't have a job.
You are not in school.
College wasn't for me. Okay?
You flunked out after one semester... which, honestly, I did not even realize was possible... because you did not try. You never try.
So I haven't figured out yet what I want to do with my life.
Okay, does that...
Who cares what you want?
Do you think that I really want to spend 80 hours a week hawking luxury lofts and million-dollar teardowns?
No, I really don't.

All the cars are locked down.
Car three was headed up to 14, and somewhere around eight, damn thing just started dropping like a rock.
How many passengers in the car?
Dispatch says two: a mother and her teenage son. The mother's hurt.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: Where's the car now?
<strong>Davis</strong>: Halfway below basement level.
That's the other problem.
Basement is flooded?
Since this morning.
Third one this month. Pipes in this place are ancient.
Every time the construction guys go near them, they burst.
And did you replace the elevator cables afterwards?
The water corrodes them.
We were gonna do that after we took care of the flooding issue.
We're gonna have to go in from above.
Buck and I should just go down with the basket.
I'll get the winch.
I'll lock and tag out the power of the cars.
Where's the elevator room?
This way.
<strong>Todd</strong>: Mom, the water's getting higher.
<strong>Marjorie</strong>: Mm-hmm.
Okay, can you move?
Mm-hmm.

I'm sorry, okay?
No, you're doing fine.
No, I mean, we're only here because of me.

( <em>Voice breaking</em> ): Dad left... because of me.
Oh, no.
You're right, okay? I'm a screwup.
I-I am, and I'm sorry.
No.
I'm sorry.
Listen to me. That is not why your father left.
Your father left... because he got bored.
Of me and our life and anything resembling responsibility.
Is that why you're so mad at me?
Because I'm like him?
You're nothing like him.
You take after me.
Okay.
And that's why I push you so hard.
Listen to me.
Okay.
Because I know... you can be so much more.
<strong>Chimney</strong>: Pressure line's ready, Cap.

Coming down.
Oh.

What the hell happened?
Hey, the-the weight of the water is pulling us down.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: All right, grab the kid, get the hell out of there.
Yeah, but we both won't fit.
I need another harness.
I don't suppose you do a lot of pull-ups?
What?
That's what I thought. ( <em>Groans</em> ) Okay.

They'll check her out more at the hospital.
It just seems like a mild concussion.
You'll just have to keep an eye on her for the next few days.
We could have died like that.
Trapped together, full of anger and resentment.
I don't want that.
But we didn't.
They got us out. We're free, Mom.
No.
I don't mean today.
I mean 20, 30 years together, stuck with each other until I draw my last breath.
You need to move out.
But I don't have a job, Ma. I...

Maybe... 25 feet.

Good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
Now-now you have to help me find my brother.
Okay, I will, I will, I will, I will.
Yeah, help. Yeah.
I promise you I will.
( <em>Cecil mutters</em> )
Uh, just stay here for one second, okay?
I'm just gonna let some light in here so I can see.
Just stay right there, okay? Don't move.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
How long have you been living like this?
Not sure what you mean. Uh...
Winslow and me... we took the house after Mom and Dad died.
( <em>Coughing</em> )
So, 1967, and...
Well, we had to protect the house, you know?
We-we wanted to make sure that nobody stole anything.
It's our house.
( <em>Voice breaking</em> ): It's our house, and we had to protect it, and I can't do this by myself, so I need you to help me find him right now.
I need you to stop what you're doing and help me find him right now!
I will. I will.
I promise you I'm gonna find your brother for you, okay?
But I need you to stay right here so I can go get him, all right?
Okay, yeah.
Okay.
Okay. Okay.
I'll be back.
I'll be back for you.
Okay. Find... find him.
Okay. Find him.

Is this cool? Like, I figured we try someplace completely not special, so-so if you had to cancel it, you wouldn't feel bad.
I'm sorry.
This is great. This is great.
Um, so how's your mom doing?
Same. I mean, worse.
You know, she's having a hard time walking, and eating is getting tougher.
But the worst part, you know, is, like, it's just the memory and the personality.
This disease... it doesn't just eat away at it like cancer does.
It almost just pushes it away.
Yeah, and, um... it sounds, it sounds... awful.
( <em>Chuckles</em> ): Sorry. I know, it sounds awful.
And I'm sure you don't want to hear it, 'cause I don't want to hear it 'cause I don't even want to be going through it.
I-I do want to hear it.
Well...
All right, you're-you're living it, and I want, I want you to talk to me.
I know, but it's just...
I think there's a reason I've been doing this... alone, you know?
It's hard to drag somebody through it.
I don't want... you know.
I don't want that for you.
( <em>Chuckles</em> )
You're breaking up with me, right?
I think I just... I'm letting you off the hook.
See, I feel like anyone else, most people, if they were dealing with the stuff you have to deal with every single day, they would, they would see it as a cage.
But you don't.
You find a way to break free.
You find a way to be yourself.
You find... life.
And if the price I have to pay for being close to a woman like you is, yeah, whatever, a couple of canceled dates, then, you know what?
Then that is one heck of a good deal, and I am in.
I'm not going anywhere.
<strong>Aaron</strong>: Now, for the star of the show.
Ah.
( <em>Aaron sighs</em> )
Duck rendang.
<strong>Athena</strong>: Wow.
( <em>Both laugh</em> )
That's a good-looking duck.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
I bet your, uh, ex-husband wasn't a gourmet chef in his spare time.
Actually, Michael's a great cook.
Mm. There's great, and then there's duck rendang great.
( <em>Laughs</em> )
Mm-hmm.
( <em>Laughs</em> )
( <em>Athena sighs</em> )
I want to run something by you.
I have a place in Big Sur.
I was thinking that we can get away for the weekend, hike, go on the beach.
No.
I can't go away with you.
I'm not even divorced yet.
It's a formality.
No. It's not.
I just got out of a 14-year marriage to a guy I thought I knew.
I'm figuring out how to be single at 50.
I'm not looking to jump into another relationship.
I want sеx with no strings.
I don't need dinners or weekend getaways.
( <em>Athena sighs</em> )
I got married because my biological clock was ticking.
I stayed married for the kids.
I'm getting divorced for myself.
I'm not ready for this.
And you...
( <em>Sighs</em> )
You are too good to be somebody's rebound guy.
Okay.
I assume you're not gonna stay the night, then?
Well... that depends...
Mm-hmm.
...on how good the duck is.
( <em>Sighs heavily</em> )
Uh, my lawyer says we're not supposed to talk.
Did you tell him that the only reason you're doing all of this is so that you and I will talk?
He is my son, too.
'Cause I carried him, I gave birth to him.
And you couldn't sign those papers to give him away fast enough, Eva. This isn't about Denny.
It's about you finding a way to get back with me.
( <em>Chuckles</em> ): Well, what's wrong with that?
I mean, we could give him a better family.
Me and you, together.
He has a family.
Now, I know that Diesel is the reason that you stayed with her all these years.
Her name is Karen.
And I love her.
But she's got you trapped, living this sad, suburban life that is not you, but when I get custody...
You know that's never gonna happen.
So tell me... what do we have to do to make you stop this insanity?
What, you need money?
We don't got a lot, but, what, that's what it's gonna take?
I want you.
You had me, Eva.
You had me.
I loved you.
I would've done anything for you.
That wasn't enough. I wasn't enough.
See, you have this fantasy of us playing house, as if I hadn't already lived through that.
( <em>Voice breaking</em> ): I know how it goes.
I know how it goes.
It's me trying over and over and over to build a life for us, and you tearing it down brick by brick by brick until I'm left alone, heartbroken, in a hole that I don't even know how to climb out of.
( <em>Sniffles</em> )
I survived you, Eva.
And I'm sure as hell not gonna let you put Denny through this.
Wait.
Just wait.
Okay, it won't be like that this time.
Oh, I can be different.
Being in that cage... it changed me.
I love you.
( <em>Sighs</em> ): I love you.
You are incapable of caring about anybody but yourself, which is why I will never let you near my son.
Count on that.
Count on it!
