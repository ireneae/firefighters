NEWSWOMAN: Lotto fever has officially swept the Southland.
The Golden State jackpot has climbed to an all-time high, sending Angelenos everywhere scrambling to grab their last-minute lottery tickets.
With no lucky winner last week, the jackpot has now...
Make it a winner this time, Ray.
Got a good feeling about this one.
I think we both gonna be winners today.
[Ray chuckles] [Paula squeals] Y'all heard him, folks.
Y'all might as well save yourself the trouble, 'cause I got the winning ticketright here!
[squeals] RAY: You go, baby. [laughs] NEWSWOMAN: Aspiring millionaires everywhere line up to make their offerings to Lady Luck.
Oh, my God.
["For the Love of Money" by The O'Jays playing] [car alarm chirps] Please, God, just this one wish.
Just this one.

Seems to have had some kind ofexistential crisis after lunch.
Threw all his money off the roof and then decided to jump after it.
Falls 20 stories and lives.
20 stories? How is that even possible?
We also got a few greedybystanders with minor injuries.
Not sure how you want to handle those.
That's up to the cap.
BUCK: Uh, interimcap.
This is just temporary until Bobby comes back.
You keep telling yourself that, Buck.
[Barry groaning] Whoa.
All right, I'll take spinal precaution.
Right, I'm the captain.
Uh, Hen, Eddie, you're with him.
Buck, go with John. Triage the minor injuries.
And I'll get the Jaws.
HEN: All right, Barry.
I'm gonna give you something for the pain, okay?
It'll take the edge off, but you're probably still gonna feel this.
Can't you just knock me out?
Sorry, I need you to stay with me.
[Barry groans] Compound fracture, both legs.
[Barry grunts, shouts] [panting] Hasn't lost bowel control.
At least I got that going for me.
These are all positives, Barry.
Means your spine's probably okay.
Ma'am, you said you saw him fall?
PAULA: Yeah.
How did he land?
Feetfirst.
Couldn't even do this right.
This morphine's nice, though.
You have anyone you need us to call?
My wife left me. My kids hate me.
My only friend is suing me.
Next time, I go headfirst.
You had all that money, though.
Why'd you throw it out the window?
That money ruined my life.
A year ago, I'd have thought it solved all my problems.
Just multiplied them.
Wait.
Wait, what-what happened last year?
I won the lottery.
Careful what you wish for.
[engine starts] [siren wailing] EDDIE: Oh, look at him.
Feel like I won the lottery.
Our son seems happy.
I swear, that kid was born happy.
I have no idea where he gets it.
From me.
Oh, you?
Hmm.
Mr. Broody?
[laughs] Well, hopefully he gets your brains.
He can't get by just on my good looks.
Oh, nice. Good one.
[both chuckle] EDDIE: He loves having you around.
SHANNON: Does he?
We both do.
Eddie.
What are we doing?
What do you mean?
I need to know what you want.
I want this.
Want to have a nice day on the beach with my son and his mother.
Okay. So...is that what I am to you?
Christopher's mother?
[groans] Because, hey, if that's what it is, it's fine.
I just...
I need to know.
Shannon...
I don't know.
I mean, these last months have been good.
Really good. I don't know.
Guess I'm just waiting for a sign.
Something...to know which way to step.
I think I might be pregnant.
[ringtone playing] Hi.
Good morning, Captain.
Good morning, Sergeant.
Checking up on me?
Mm, not at all.
I'm just jealous of your life of leisure.
[chuckles] Leisure?
You kidding me? I'm about to embark on a project so grand and so vast that I won't have a moment to even think about something as insignificant as possibly having my life's work taken away from me.
Oh, yes?
Yeah. I am gonna plan us a real wedding.
Obviously, I won't make any decisions without you.
Oh, no.
Feel free to pick out everything except the dress.
All I need on that day are just you and the kids.
All the other details? Have at it.
You know, if there's an upside to this suspension, it's that I get a chance to really concentrate on this.
Make the occasion worthy of the bride.
Oh!
Well, smooth-talk the investigating committee like that, there won't be a suspension for long.
Be safe out there, Sergeant.
I love you.
I love you, too.
[knock on door] Hey.
Hey. Am I bothering you?
Y-You would tell me if I'm bothering you, right?
No, you're not bothering me.
Okay, good. Um...
When are you coming back?
Uh, I don't know, Buck. I-I might not be.
That's unacceptable.
We need to get you unsuspended.
Maybe I can talk to the chief, you know, testify on your behalf.
That-that would help, right?
Uh, you might get suspended, too. Let's...
We need you back, Bobby.
The place doesn't work without you.
So, we're doing lineups now?
Stow it, Buckley.
BOBBY: Buck, it's been two shifts. But I thought that having Chimney be in chargewould be easier on all of you. He's your friend.
Yeah, Chimney is my friend.
Interim Captain Han?
He's a monster.
CHIMNEY: Listen up.
Because the word of the day is "hose maintenance." Okay, I'm out.
BOBBY:  He's just being conscientious.
Conscientious? Or mad with power?
That's not the most efficient way to do it, guys.
Look, a week ago, Chimney was one of you.
Now he's responsible for all of you.
It's an adjustment for everybody.
Well, exactly how long will we be adjusting, Cap?
Because Responsible Chimney is freaking me out.
CHIMNEY: Get it nice and tight.
Clean line.
Watching, Buckley?
Yep.
HEN: It's not good.
[scoffs] He's not you, Cap.
You shouldn't expect him to be.
[exhales] You should tell him that.
This is shaking beef because you shake it.
Whoa. Uh...
Fire. Uh, fire.
Uh...
Chim, back up.
[Chimney coughs] BUCK: Smell that?
What's going on?
What's for dinner?
CHIMNEY: Okay, relax. There's plenty for everybody.
Maybe now would be a good time to reflect on our hose training. Hey, hey, hey!
The 118 eats dinner as a family, even if it is crappy pizza.
Sit down, Diaz.
Sorry, Cap. It won't happen again.
I just sat there.
I didn't know what to say.
Well, that's understandable.
You sure I'm not in your hair?
It's fine.
See, I don't know, Cap.
Another baby?
I mean, are we ready for that?
Were you ready the first time?
No. I...
I knew I loved her, but I didn't think I was ready to get married.
If you two do decide to have another baby, you'll figure it out.
We already know you're a great dad.
I guess the question is, can I be a good husband?
That is a question.
Are you ready to ask it?
I don't know. It's just a stupid dance.
Probably shouldn't even go.
You like this girl.
So ask her out. See what happens.
What if she laughs at me?
What if she doesn't?
You don't think I was nervous when I asked your mother out?
You have a fire engine.
I do.
Well...I did.
They all hate me.
They don't hate you, Chim.
No, they do. This, like, a bad time?
It's fine.
You know, when the chief asked me to take over, I thought it would be fun, you know?
A couple of weeks of bossing everyone around.
Making Buck wash my car. What's not to love?
Except apparently everything.
Sometimes it's not easy being the boss.
Can I change my mind? Stop being their boss, go back to being their friend?
A good captain finds a way to do both.
[sighs] I don't think I'm up to it.
You can do this, Chim. You don't have to worry about being their friend. You already are.
You can do this because you know this team, you know what they're capable ofand they trust you.
Now you just have to trust themand yourself.
Don't push them. Lead them.
CAROL: Now, we get lots of tours in here, but it's not every daywe get to meet the reigning South Pasadena sixth grade bake sale champs.
[students cheer] [Carol chuckles] Who knows the difference between cocoa and cacao?
Very good.
After the cacao nib is milled, it goes through the grinder, which causes it to melt. That liquid is then...
LISA: Mr. Dubraunstein?
Are you sure you're okay being here?
Isn't it like an alcoholic touring a distillery?
I didn't lose 195 pounds by being some fragile flower.
It was sheer willpower.
Oh.
I greatly admire that. [chuckles] Well, that, and I didn't want to hear the students call me "Mr. Du-fatstein" behind my back for another miserable year.
Children can be so cruel.
Especially the gifted ones. [groans] CAROL: Okay, who's ready for some samples?
[Carol chuckles] MAN: There you go.
Everyone take a sample.
Only one each.
Our chocolate liquor-- teachers, it's N. A.-- is kept heated to 110 degrees.
First-time tasters say this is like nothing they've ever experienced before.
["I Like Candy" by Bow Wow Wow playing] That is good.
Yummy, right? Mm-hmm.
All right, now, if you'll throw your cups away and follow me to the packaging room.

[groans] ♪ Hey!♪ We tried pulling him out, but he was struggling so much that he sank even deeper.
Our chocolate is the richest in the country, but...
unfortunately, that also makes it the heaviest.
Sir? Sir, how you feeling in there?
W-W-Warm.
CAROL: We had to leave the heat on.
My foreman was afraid if we didn't that the whole batch would just harden up.
Then we'd be chiseling him out.
All right, let's get to work!
The pressure on his body is probably slowing his circulation.
We don't get him out of here soon, he may lose consciousness.
CHIMNEY: All right, boys, let's pull him out.
EDDIE: Here, can you reach your hands above the surface?
No.
All right, we're gonna have to grab under his arms.
Okay, ready?
Pull on three.
One, two, three.
[strained grunting] [gasping, grunting] I got you, I got you. [strained grunt] What's happening here?
Physics. Physics is happening here.
You're creating a low-pressure pocket when you pull him up, and then that pocketis pulling him right back down.
Great. So basically chocolate quicksand.
Okay, everybody just stop for a second.
Hen, take out an O2 tank, rip off the mask, create an air tube.
It'll buy us some time if he goes completely under.
Time for what?
For me to think.
[grunting] Get him, get him, get him.
[panting] HEN: Here. Try to...
try to bite this tube with yourtongue so you don't lose it.
Okay, good. Okay, now what, Captain?
Did our cap just run away?
I think he went that way.
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[shouting] HEN: Breathe. Keep breathing, keep breathing.
CHIMNEY: Coming through!
HEN:Keep breathing, keep breathing,keep breathing now.
Keep breathing.
The hell?
It's cocoa butter. Tempers the chocolate, decreases the viscosity.
What? Stir.
[groaning loudly] Okay.
[grunting] Yeah. Keep-keep...keep mixing!
It's working! There we go!
[Hen grunts] Okay, here he comes.
More, more, more!
[grunting] [grunts] Keep mixing!
[chuckles]: I lied.
I have no willpower.
I got lap-band surgery.
Quick thinking, Cap.
That was something.
You weren't so sure that I could do it, were you?
You called Bobby, didn't you?
I went down to the...
I turned on the...
He's a chef.
A good captain utilizes all his resources.
Mm-hmm.
[chuckles] It's not cheating.
Ma'am, I'm having trouble understanding you.
You need to slow down. What's the address again?
225 Pinecrest Lane. It's my brother.
He called me to say goodbye. You have to hurry.
Please send someone!
Police are already on their way. You said he called you.
When was that and where are you?
A few minutes ago. I didn't understand what he was saying at first. Damn it!
[horn honking] Turn already! Move!
I'm not gonna make it in time.  He's all alone, and I don't...
The officers will be there soon.
He won't be alone for long.
So let's focus on getting you home safe.
Take a deep breath.
Calm down.
[crying] [takes deep breath] What's your name?
Nicole.
Hi, Nicole. I'm Maddie.
We're gonna get you through this together.
What's your brother's name?
Sam. Foster.
Does Sam have any history of mental illness?
He's bipolar.
Bipolar 1.
Does he take medication for that?
He takes...I don't know. They switched his meds a few weeks ago. I can't remember.
That's okay.
Has Sam attempted suicide before?
More than once.
You said that he called you to say goodbye-- what did he say?
That he loved me.
That he was sorry, but he just couldn't do it anymore.
He was so tired.
You guys have been fighting like this for a while?
Since college.
But I thought...I thought the new meds were working.
[horn honking] He seemed better.
I wouldn't have left him if I...
Oh, God. I shouldn't have left him.
I shouldn't have gone out.
Nicole...
this is not your fault.
Don't even think about that right now.
Just focus on helping Sam.
Right. I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.
I know it's scary.
Has Sam ever been violent?
Not to other people.
Just himself.
And he seemed okay when you left the house?
Yeah. We had breakfast, and he said he was having a good day, and I believed him.
Wanted to believe him.
It's been so long since he felt okay, and I thought, for an hour, we could both just...
just breathe.
I'm here. I'm here.
I'm turning on my street.
Uh, y-you're at your house?
I'm pulling up. I see police cars.
Why are there so many?
[line beeping] [panting]: N-Nicole?
Nicole?
Hey.
How's your day?
Unfinished. [wry chuckle] Are you saying that 'cause you're only halfway through a shift, or is something else going on?-You know that thing when you're in the thick of an emergency and you're helping someone, and then help arrives, and...
And they hang up on you.
Yeah, and you-you never get to know how it ends.
Don't you ever wonder?
All the time.
You can pull the reports, Maddie, but I don't recommend it.
If you don't read 'em, you can't know, and as long as you don't know...you can still hope.
For what?
Everyone lived.
Up here, I've never lost a call.
When I was a nurse, for every person there was abeginning, a middle and an end.
And you were there...for all of it.
You didn't just...
hang up and then pass theresponsibility to someone else.
That's the job.-Yeah, but if you're not there, if you don't know how the story ends, then how do you know if you're doing it right?
How do you know if you've made a difference?
You don't.
[sighs] That's why not everyone can do this.
Though I was pretty sure you could.
I didn't leave nursing.
I left Doug.
And this was a fallback plan, you know?
It was a safe place where I could just be a voice and not be seen.
But Doug is...
he's gone now, and...
I'm free.
To what?
What do you want to do?
[sighs] I wish I knew.
[takes deep breath] NED: Mm.
[both chuckle] Ah.
Peonies.
[chuckles] Like clockwork every year.
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.
Mwah! Happy 25th.
Oh, I know. Right, huh?
I called Roberto, and he's giving us the table in front.
Oh. We're going to Roberto's?
We always go to Roberto's.
I'm sorry, honey.
Were you wishing that I'd pick someplace else?
Wishes are for suckers.
Come here.
[laughing] Mmm!
[doorbell rings] Oh. Well, you go get your keys, and I'll get the door.
Okay.
Oh, Ned.
I guess you can still surprise me after all.
[chuckles] [siren wailing, horn blowing] All right. Could I get that ETA?
Mail bomb. Wife's in rough shape, but she's still in one piece.
The house hasn't been cleared yet.
Bomb squad's still a couple of minutes out.
Copy that. Let's move!
NED: Here!
She's not breathing!
I tried talking to her, but she wouldn't answer.
BUCK: She can't hear you 'cause her eardrums are blown out.
All right, let's turn her.
On it.
Ready.
Eddie and I can handle this.
Breathing's shallow. We're looking at a bilateral pneumothorax.
We don't release the pressure, she could suffocate.
I did my share of these in combat.
Get some fentanyl, slow drip.
Chim, there's post-attack protocol.
You're the captain.
I'm also the most experienced paramedic on-site.
Four-inch catheter, ten-gauge.
All right, Buck and Eddie, therecould be a secondary device.
We need to get everyone off the "X." Sir, is there anyone else in the house?
Uh...no, no. Is she gonnamake it? Please, please, please tell me she's gonna make it.
Why don't you come with us?
We can check you out.
No, no, no, she has to know that-that we weren't just going out to dinner.
I had tickets for us to Fiji!
You can tell her...
You can tell her yourself later, I promise.
[grunts] HEN: Ma'am, can you hear me? You're going to feel a pinch, but it's gonna relieve the pressure.
[gasping] All right, tape her!
Sharp!
[gasping continues] [guttural groaning] [inhales sharply] [screaming] All right, tape her!
[crying]: No!
Sharp!
Got it.
All right, let's move her!
[crying] Ready? Three, two, one.
I'm here, sweetheart.
I'm right here.
[echoing]: I love you.
[door closes] [Shannon laughing] [speaking Spanish] We just had lunch with your...abuela.
ABUELA: Hola.
Hola.
SHANNON: And now, we're gonna get some...
Ice cream!
[laughs]: Oh, ice cream?
Well, I do not envy you putting him to sleep tonight.
When I call you later to complain, just don't say "I told you so"?
[chuckles] All right, I promise.
I love you.
I love you.
[metallic scraping] Ooh! When's the wedding?
We're already married. Wait.
We don't have to get married again, do we?
Talk to Bobby.
Maybe he can get you guys a discount.
[chuckles] [sighs] Sue.
Sorry. I know that you're on your way out.
Oh, Don's picking me up.
Now matter how many watches Igive that man, he's always late.
[chuckles] I am not gonna be able to take the extra shift on Friday.
I had something scheduled for the morning, but then they called, and they needed itin the afternoon, so...
That's okay. I'll get someone else to cover.
Have a good night.
It's a job interview.
I-I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be telling you that.
It just feels weird hiding it.
So you've decided, then?
You're leaving us.
Josh told me about the talk.
I spent...years not having a voice, and now that I do, it just feels likewhat I'm saying doesn't matter.
Oh, I think you underestimate yourself and your contribution here.
I appreciate that.
But, honestly, here, I'm just a person who sends help, and I need to get back to beingthe person who gives it.
EDDIE: Voilà.
SHANNON: Ooh, Eddie, I love these.
So is this some kind of Forrest Gumpreference?
"Life is like a box of chocolates"?
Actually, uh, life is like a vat of molten chocolate.
Yeah, sometimes you...
you fall into it, it drags you down, but it-it's...it's warm, you know?
It-It's...and it's...
It's sweet.
This is a very weird metaphor.
[sighs] When you came back into our lives, I was so glad.
And afraid.
[chuckles softly] I knew Christopher missed you, but I-I...
I don't think I realized just...
how much I did, too.
Eddie, uh, I think...
Oh, please, just let me say this.
We were so young the first time.
You know, young and not ready.
But we had this amazing kid.
Being his dad has been thesingle greatest joy of my life.
And that little boy has...tau.. taught me more about being a man than war ever did.
You're a good dad.
You're a great dad.
Well, if I am it's because...he deserves it.
Yeah.
But he deserves his mommy, too.
He loves his mommy.
[chuckles] So do I.
♪ We could have done better♪ ♪ We could have tried harder♪ I want us to be a family again.
♪ We could have been stronger...♪ I wished for a sign.
[chuckles softly] ♪ We could have been so much more...♪ And I got one.
I'm not pregnant.
What?
I'm not...pregnant.
I...I was just late.
I freaked out, and then, I freaked you out, too, and I'm sorry.
That's got to be a relief, right?
It...it doesn't change a thing.
It does for me.
What?
I wrote this letter a few years ago right after I left, or, actually, after I...
didn't come back...
to Christopher...
trying to explain why I couldn't be there.
And I figured that if, for some reason, I never found my way back, that he'd want answers.
And he needed to know that...
it wasn't his fault.
That his mother didn't leave because she didn't love him.
She left because she did.
I never sent it, obviously.
And then, when I found out todaythat I wasn't pregnant, I took that letter out, I read it.
Eddie, I never want to have to send that letter.
Why would you ever?
Because if I try to do this again before I'm ready, there won't be a second chance.
[crying]: I can't fail him again, or you, and I won't.
I'm still learning how to be someone's mother.
And after that, maybe I canlearn how to be someone's wife.
We're still married.
I think we should get a divorce.
Glad you came.
Yeah, I'm always down for coffee, but what's really going on?
Remember your first call?
Uh, anaphylactic shock-- seafood allergy.
You remember the first lesson I taught you on that call?
Yes, you taught me to listen.
Okay, terrific.
So, do that now.
Sue and I were on the phone for a long time last night trying to find a way to convince you of the difference you've made.
Look, I really appreciate that you and Sue were talking...
I never said that Sue and I were talking to each other.
NICOLE: "We're gonna get through this together." Nicole?
Yeah.
Wait.
Is-is Sam...?
He's okay.
Oh.
The police got there in time, and I got home in one piece.
Because of you.
Hearing your voice-- it...
it kept me focused, gave me hope.
Your voice saved my life.
Even though I didn't hear it.
I was unconscious, in labor.
The earthquake had just hit, and I...I was dying.
We both were.
[baby cooing] I didn't know what to do. You said help wasn't coming.
It should have been terrifying, but your voice was so calm and reassuring.
And you-you got us help in a wayI never could have expected.
Same here.
Because of you, I made it home for Christmas.
Just because you said I would.
Brandon.
Seattle.
My emergency was I was an overworked idiot, but you made sure they found me.
You saved my life.
Hey, you saved our marriage.
I was on the edge.
Literally on the edge, justlost, and then I saw my Norman.
And it's because you found a way to get him to me.
You helped us find our way backto each other.
You did.
GLORIA: I probably would have hung up on you.
I'm just being honest.
Maddie has more patience than I ever did.
Gloria.
I thought that you were...
Took a plea,and since we skipped the trial, I never got a chance to see you again to tell you...I was wrong.
About hanging up on people?
About the dead-end calls, the people that couldn't be saved.
I always thought there was nothing I could do for them, but there was.
I could've listened, just been there for them at the end so they didn't have to be alone.
But is that enough?
I mean, I'm there for them in the beginning, I'm there for them...in the middle, but it still doesn't seem like it's enough to make a difference.
It's not...until it's your emergency.
And then you...
you realize that the middle is the scariest part, because you don't just need help.
You need hope.
[chairs scraping] And that's what your voice is, Maddie.
It's hope.
Thank you.
[exhales] All right, make way! LAFD!
All right, John, triage the minor injuries.
Hen, you're with me.
Buck and Eddie, check the driver.
Ma'am, can you hear me?

I tried to stop, but I didn't see any of them.
Are they okay?
Yeah, we're taking care of the others, ma'am.
Right now, we need to see if you're okay.
Um, m-my neck hurts. Oh, God.
Okay, ma'am, we're gonna put this on you as a precaution until the doctors atthe hospital can check you out.

Not yet.

I want your life to be happy and free and full of joy.
And I'm not sure  that's possible with me in it.
It's okay to hate me for leaving.
I will understand if you never forgive me.
♪ But always know that I love you, baby.
Even if it's from a distance.
[crying] [knocking] [knocking continues] [sniffles] I'm not in the mood for a lecture, Hen.
So if you're here to tell me how I screwed up today, gonna have to wait till I finish this six-pack.
[exhales] I wanted to see if you were okay.
I guess I have my answer.
Oh, I'm fine.
I'm not the one with the dead wife.
Or any wife.
Which is probably good, because...
I was pretty cool with letting Eddie's just die.
Is that what you think happened?
I think I withheld medical carefor a patient and she died.
Chim, she was dead when we got there, okay?
Just took a few minutes for herbrain to catch up with her body.
You know, I keep going itover and over again in my head.
[exhales] What would Bobby do?
How would Bobby have...
Bobby is not the captain right now, Chim.
You are.
And you had a tough call.
But you made the right one.
I'm proud of you.
You're proud of me?
For this?
For all of it.
Listen, I know I'm--I've-I've given you some grief.
[sighs] Well, I have been alittle on the insufferable side.
You've been a nightmare.
[chuckles] But, still, the truth is...
this promotion has left me a little conflicted.
I mean, as your friend, I want to see you succeed, but...
You didn't think I could do it.
Hell no.
I knew you could do it.
My fear was, once you realized you could do it, life as a paramedic, as my partner...
wouldn't be good enough.
[sniffles] [chuckles softly] [sniffles] I miss it, you know.
Being in the ambulance with you.
Kicking ass. Saving lives.
I feel like everything's changing.
Not this.
You might not be my partner now, but you're still my best friend, Chim.
And that's never gonna change.
[chuckles] [sniffles] [elevator dings] We don't have to do this today.
I thought it'd be a good distraction, but, um...
Yeah, it feels wrong.
Yeah.
Looking at wedding venueswhen Eddie's planning a funeral.
Seeing him in the hospital, it just took me right back.
Okay.
Let's just go home.
Yeah. Thanks.
[Athena chuckles] Well, we're probably not a hotel ballroom kind of couple anyway.
I mean, it's just too...
traditional. Too formal.
What kind of couple are we? Backyard barbecue or...
destination wedding?
NEWSMAN: ...package bomb explodes in as many days.
Authorities are urging the public to be on high alert tonight.
Everything okay?
The suspicious package was left on the doorstep of a home in Westwood sometime in the afternoon.
BOBBY: Package bomb in Westwood?
That's not the scene that you were called to the other day.
No, no, no. A new one.
A retiree attempted to open it.
That man, whose name is being withheld, fights for life at this very hour.
Two bombs in one week?
That's not a coincidence.
That's a serial bomber just getting started.
