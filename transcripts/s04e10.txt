All you got to do is hang on.
Push through the pain.
"911," all-new Mondays.
And watch other Fox shows like "Lone Star," "Prodigal Son," and "The Resident" on Fox.
Hey there, all my Successful Super Moms.
This is Beth Reidman coming to you live from my son Bryson's 12th birthday party!
I am gonna show you how a Successful Super Mom -- or Dad -- throws a birthday bash.
Oh, and there's the birthday boy right now.
How are you enjoying the party?
Oops. Technical difficulties.
Or maybe you could be a normal mom and not go live on the Gram.
And disappoint my sponsors who were generous enough to give us all this stuff for free, by the way?
But it's so lame.
I can't believe you made me wear this.
Why couldn't we just do paintball or laser tag, like I wanted? This stuff is for babies.
Too violent. Those games are like simulated war -- I can't put that on my blog.
Oh, so this party is for you?
To give you content for your blog?
My blog and all the sponsored content is what pays the bills around here.
You're embarrassing me in front of my friends.
What are you talking about?
Everyone is having a great time.
The trampoline is a hit.
Everything here is for babies.
I'm 12, Mom.
So I guess that means you don't want to play pin the tail on the donkey?
Pin the tail on the donkey?
I think I liked it better when you had a real job.
What do I have to do to prove to her I'm not a kid anymore, pay taxes?
And now for a party favorite, pin the tail on the donkey!
This game is a classic that is guaranteed to keep the kids having fun.
We're not eight years old.
Come on, guys, try it.
It's fun!
Mm, nah.
Okay. I guess I'll go first.
Your mom's really into this party.
It's kind of weird.
Shut up.
I hate...
this stupid...party!
Mom!
I was jumping on the trampoline, and a spring flew off.
Okay.
And it almost killed me.
All right, let's see what we got.
Looks like she's pinned to the wall in two places.
All right. Let's go, let's go.
Ma'am, don't move.
Any movement could cause that spring to shift, and that would not be good.
Must've been traveling at top speed.
Put a hole right through her hand.
And her torso. Ow.
Is she gonna be okay?
Give us some space.
We're gonna take real good care of your mom, I promise.
Can you move your fingers?
I think so.
Good. Means the spring likely missed the tendon.
No nerve damage.
Oh, thank God. It's my selfie hand.
Pulse is slightly elevated, but BP's normal.
Miraculously, she's stable.
Getting bilateral breath sounds.
Spring likely didn't puncture her lungs, but it's probably millimeters away from her spine.
I can pack the wound, but I don't know how to detach her from the barn.
We don't. Transport her with it, donkey and all.
Where's Buck?
This is a circular saw.
This blade is strong enough to cut through anything.
Cool.
Even metal.
I'll bet it could slice through bone, too.
Uh, yeah, we don't...
Buck! We need that saw.
I gotta go. Sorry.
You went really hard-core with this party design.
It's my job.
Literally. I run a mommy blog. I spent months planning this thing, trying to make it perfect, and my kid hates me for it.
He doesn't hate you. He's just 12.
He'll get over it.
Feels like no matter what I do, it's wrong.
You did a great job constructing the shed.
Really quality work.
It was from a kit.
I didn't even pick it out.
A sponsor sent it.
Well, at least you have help taking it down.
Almost there.
Last one, Cap.
Okay, so, phase one was a success, but there's no way we get her in this door in the ambulance.
We got to call for a flatbed.
We got a penetrating trauma.
I don't think we can wait.
Got any other options?
Easy, guys, easy.
Watch the springs.
Easy.
Good work.
Oh, Mom!
I got your phone!
Thank you, sweetie.
I'm sorry I treated you like a little kid. You were right.
I'm just gonna go back to my soul-sucking job.
But, Mom, I don't think you should give up the blog.
Look.
Oh, my God. I was live the whole time?
Look. You're trending. You're gonna be Internet-famous.
We're gonna be rich!
Oh! I am monetizing parenthood!
Ow!
<i>Hey, sweetie.</i> What are you doing up?
Can I sleep with you and Mama?
Well, of course.
Get on up in here.
You have a bad dream?
No.
Mm, you just want to cuddle, that's it.
You okay?
You're worried about tomorrow.
About Nia leaving.
I don't want her to go away.
I know I get mad at her sometimes.
I just don't want her to leave.
Neither do we.
It's like we talked about.
Nia came to live with us, because her real mom couldn't take care of her.
But now her mom is better, so Nia gets to go home to her.
Now, that's gonna hurt for us, but it'll be good for Nia.
You're not my real moms.
Are you gonna have to give me back, too?
Denny, we are your real moms.
We're your mothers in every way that matters.
And no one is ever taking you away from us.
We even have a piece of paper from a judge that says so.
Did my real...
Did my <i>other</i> mom not want me?
Sweetie, she was sick, and she wasn't in a place where she could take care of you.
And it was a hard decision, but she wanted the best for you.
And that's why she gave you to us.
So we could love and protect you and be your moms forever.
So, nobody's gonna come and take me away?
Not ever.
I promise.
<i>Here.</i> I didn't like it when you took it off my bed, but I want you to have it so you can remember me.
And don't forget him. I know he's your favorite.
You play later with me?
I don't think I can.
Oh.
You're going home to your mommy today, remember?
Denny come with me?
Not this time.
Why don't you say goodbye?
Oh, that's a good hug.
I'm gonna miss those.
Hey. You know, we, uh...
we never gave this...
this guy a name.
What are you gonna call him?
Denny!
For...for big brother.
That's great. That's great.
He'll look after you, just like a big brother.
We love you, Nia.
Always remember that.
I love you, too, Mama Hen.
You ready, Nia?
Ready.
See you later. No.
Sweetie.
No, we will...we will see you later.
We love you.
I love you, too.
Hey, Denny, why don't you head into the kitchen?
I think your grandma's making you a special lunch.
Okay.
KAREN When we, uh...
When we took her in, we weren't thinking about the day we'd have to give her back.
Yeah.
That it would be this hard.
I know. I've been doing this a long time.
And it's never easy.
It's not for everyone. A lot of folks never go back for a second placement.
Yeah. I guess that's something we have to think about and discuss.
There's nothing to discuss.
I never want to do this again.
You're gonna be late if you keep watching her.
You sure you're gonna be okay on your own? I hate to leave you guys.
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Whoa. What the...?
I'll go. You stay here.
Albert, what happened?
Yeah.
I was trying to get something off the shelf.
I lost my balance.
Why didn't you ask for me or Maddie?
You already have a baby to take care of. You don't need two.
What we don't need is you hurting yourself because you're too stubborn to ask for help.
I should be better. The accident was weeks ago.
The doctor said there would be lingering issues, balance being one of them.
You just got to be patient.
And quit trying to do stuff on your own. Let us help.
Are you going out?
Yeah, first day back to work.
We talked about that, remember?
Maybe. Still feels like my brain's in a fog sometimes.
I got to go. Listen, Maddie will be here with you.
If you need something, ask.
Please.
Maybe I could make her breakfast, help her for a change.
And it would be good practice.
Does Maddie like waffles?
Let's not overdo it, okay?
Just get some rest, Albert.
Don't worry about breakfast.
Feels like all I do is rest.
Is he okay?
Little mishap with a shelf.
I'll deal with it when I get home.
You look really handsome for your first day back.
Sexy, too.
Ah.
Well, you're gonna have to hold that thought.
There's nothing we can do about it while we're out here sleeping on an air mattress.
Yeah. I love you. Have a great first day.
Love you, too. And text me if she does anything cute.
Oh, okay. So, like, every other minute?
Exactly.
That's the first time she smiled.
Sure that's a smile? That's the same face Buck makes when he's gassy.
I will take that as a compliment, 'cause it just means she looks like her Uncle Buck.
God, I love her so much. I don't even feel like the same person anymore. Is that weird?
What's that saying? Having a kid is like walking around with your heart outside your body.
Okay, that's weirder. And morbid.
Just means it's a whole different kind of love.
How's Maddie doing? First solo shift with the baby.
Babies. Plural. She's pulling double duty. Albert and Jee-Yun.
Offer still stands, you know. He can come back to my place.
He needs round-the-clock care.
He can't be on his own for a whole 24 hours.
With the new schedule, one of us is always home.
If you and Maddie are working opposite schedules, when do you actually see each other?
Haven't quite figured that out yet.
Oh, uh, she-she's coming.
So, uh, yeah. The doctor said Albert's physical therapy is going great.
HEN Welcome back!
Hey! I was just filling them in on Albert's recovery.
I am disappointed in you guys.
Where's the banner? Where's the balloons?
This is not how we do when somebody comes back to work.
I said it was okay. I don't need that kind of stuff.
Not when, uh...
No, no, no, no. We celebrate every good moment. When we can.
Now, let me see these baby pictures.
Okay.
Oh, my God, she's so big already.
Yeah. They grow up fast.
Aw.
♪ <i>Ah, yeah</i> ♪ Ow. Ow.
Ow.
Oh!
Crap.
Please, you have to send help. I can't move.
What's your name and location, sir?
2016 Irvine Street.
And your name?
I don't see why that matters.
Please, <i>just send someone, quietly.</i> Why are you whispering?
<i>Yes, we heard a crash outside.</i> Where are you right now?
Can you see if the intruder is armed?
<i>I'm in the bedroom.</i> I don't know, uh, I don't know if he's armed.
Tell them to send the police, Trish.
I am. Uh, can you please send the police? We're at <i>2016 Irvine Street.</i> Ma'am, i-is there anyone else in your home that might have also called 911?
No, it's just-just me and my husband.
<i>Why?</i> Josh, why are you sending police units to my broken leg?
Homeowners called and said there was a burglar outside.
That must be your guy.
My broken leg was breaking in?
Yeah.
Sir, uh, the address you gave me -- is this your residence?
CONNOR Yes.
Yes.
<i>At least it used to be.</i> I'm gonna need your name.
All right, let's see what we got here.
Connor!
Got a compound tib-fib fracture to the right leg.
It's pretty nasty.
Got some bone hanging out.
Sir, can you feel when I do this?
Oh, God. Yeah, yeah.
Good. Then his pedal pulse is strong, which means he's still got blood flowing.
PERRLA response is good.
Pupils are equal and reactive.
All right, sir, I'm gonna give you something to help with the pain, but you have to try and stay still.
After a fall like that, we can't rule out spinal injury.
This is all your fault.
I wasn't the one climbing up the trellis like some two-bit cat burglar.
It's 'cause you kicked me out.
Okay? It was either sneak in or sleep in my car.
You had plenty of other options.
Like -- I don't know -- get a job, pay rent.
You don't need rent! You're rich!
It's called hard work paying off.
Will you stop being so hard on him?
He's just going through a quarter-life crisis.
That's a load of...
That's a real thing.
I've been there.
You need to stop enabling him.
You want to be the good cop, so you always make me the bad cop.
I'm sick of it.
Can't you both be good cops?
No.
No.
No.
Let's get him on a backboard.
But does tough love actually work, or does it just make your kid hate you?
Some kids need discipline.
But not too much.
I'm curious to know what your definition of "too much discipline" is.
All right, one, two, three.
Officer? I'd like you to arrest this man.
You want her to arrest your son?
They're related?
We have a restraining order against him.
He wouldn't leave. He was taking us for everything we got.
I had to do something.
Are you gonna arrest him?
You might want to check this out first.
Looks like the bolts have been snapped, real clean breaks.
That's why the kid fell down.
Any idea how that happened?
Nope, no idea.
Well, you were up there a few days ago repairing it.
What kind of repairs? Yeah.
Just, uh, some basic stuff. It was fine the last time I broke in.
See?
That's what I'm talking about.
He's been breaking in for weeks.
He needed to be taught a lesson.
Are you saying that you knew your son was using the trellis, and you cut it intentionally to cause bodily harm?
To your own flesh and blood.
You've coddled him too long, Trish.
You need to decide whose side you're on.
<i>Is he gonna</i> be okay?
Well, he'll need surgery, and it'll be a long recovery, but he'll make it.
Don't worry, sweetheart. Mommy will take care of you.
Trish, you're making a mistake!
You know what? Find a new place to live, Harv.
I'm changing the locks.
Interesting parenting techniques.
Yeah. That kid is never growing up.
You're home. I am running so late.
Jee's having a fussy morning.
She cries every time I put her down.
Um, I fed her an hour ago so you're good for two.
There's breast milk in the fridge, but not much else.
So maybe you could get some groceries?
Oh, and don't forget, Albert has his physical therapy at 3:00 p. m., okay?
Love you. I love you. Bye.
Did you get all that?
Yeah, me, neither.
Oh...
WOMAN She's coming. She's coming.
Surprise!
Oh, my God.
You guys did not have to do this.
Well, of course we do.
We didn't get a chance to throw you a shower.
Well, the least we can do is give you a good welcome back.
Mm-hmm. That one is for baby. Aw.
This is for Mommy.
Uh, how does it feel being back?
Weird. I mean, I haven't left the house in two months, except for doctor's appointments.
Ah, just wait for the mom guilt to set in.
And everyone's gonna have advice. Don't take it.
You have to figure out what works best for yourself.
Except for this. Didn't you just say that she should...?
Uh, you can have it all, but you can't do it all.
Delegate, get help. Don't be a martyr.
She's right. It takes a village.
So use your village.
Ah.
It's good to have you back.
It's good to be back.
Let's go get cake.
Yes.
You ready for this?
No. Basically ran out of the house this morning before I could change my mind and not leave Jee's side until she's 40.
I have no idea what that feels like, but...
I do know that I'm here for you, whatever you need.
Other than babysitting. That feels like a lot of pressure.
It's okay. Chimney's got us covered.
Albert, did you take your medicine?
I forgot.
Okay.
Here.
Can you help?
Uh, yeah, sure. Just give me a second.
Aah! Damn it!
Are you okay?
Definitely not.
Mrs. Lee.
Anne. That is still weird for me. Please come in.
Hi, Anne.
I come bearing soup.
Aw. What are you doing?
Why didn't you let me know you were coming?
I would have picked up a little or lit a match.
Nonsense.
No need to make things perfect for me.
Oh. I think she's hungry.
I was just making her a bottle and Albert's lunch.
And I might need to make her another one. Okay.
Here, let me.
I'll feed the baby, you two eat.
Thank you.
So, I know that you didn't just happen to be in the neighborhood.
Did Maddie ask you to come in and check on me?
So suspicious.
You know, Maddie asked me the same question when I called her yesterday.
I just wanted to see if you two needed any help.
That's very sweet of you, but we're fine.
I think we've all got it under control.
We do?
Actually, Anne, do you mind taking me to my therapy session so that Howie doesn't have to?
Happy to.
Hey.
You remembered your appointment. That's great.
Uh, no, but I still know how to read.
You two have busy schedules.
Yeah. I know it looks crazy, but, uh, Maddie and I are making it work.
We don't want to lose a second with Jee-Yun, and leaving her with strangers...
Of course, I...I wouldn't want to overstep.
Oh. No. No, no, no, I-I...
I didn't mean that. That's not what I...
I'm ready.
Great. Um, we should get going.
Well, wait, uh...Well, uh...
See you later, Howie.
Goodbye, Howard.
Well, uh, wait.
Anne?
Thought I'd find you in here, torturing yourself.
It's a little hard to let it go, Ma.
And please don't tell me I knew what I was signing up for.
I wasn't gonna say anything 'cause I don't have the answer.
I wish I did.
I hate to see you hurting like this.
I just miss her.
And I loved her like she was my own.
And a year from now, she won't even remember who I am.
I'm not so sure about that.
She might not be able to recall specific memories, but she will remember how you made her feel.
Loved.
Protected.
Safe.
She won't forget that.
She will carry that with her always.
Because of you.
Honey, I know.
I know.
Let it out.
<i>All right, make sure</i> you have everything you need <i>before you get in the car</i> or your dad will have my head. Uh, Harry, can you pass me my phone?
I said to <i>pass</i> me the phone, not check it. Laila liked your post on Instagram.
Give it. Wait, isn't she that mean girl that you went to high school with?
Why are you talking to her?
She reached out to me a couple weeks ago.
Out of the blue.
Said she wanted to apologize for what happened.
Hmm. And you told her, "Go to hell." No. Um, I met her for coffee and heard her out. That's it.
She trashed your reputation on social media, said terrible lies about you, and that's it?
No big deal?
I feel like I at least owed it to her to listen.
You don't owe her a damn thing.
After what she did to you?
You did arrest her. Or did you forget that part?
I didn't forget a single thing about that...incident.
I-I can't believe that you didn't tell me about this.
Why would you hide it from me?
Hello? This entire conversation.
I never know how you're gonna react these days. You're always worried about me -- you don't like my job, and apparently, now you don't like my friends.
So now she's your friend?
May! What-what-what are you doing?
Letting this girl get back in your head again?
She's changed. I have changed.
So I'm giving her a second chance.
What's wrong with that?
Because the last time you were friends with that girl, you tried to kill yourself!
LAFD!
Can I help you?
LAFD, ma'am. We got a call about an overdose?
You must have the wrong address.
This is 4941 North Orchard Drive.
Yes.
Dispatcher said they got a call from an Ellen Saxton?
What? Uh, that's my mom.
Mama?
Finally.
Mom, wh-what's wrong? You called 911?
Are you okay?
I'm dying, Julia.
Cancer.
Also, I may have taken something to...speed up the dying process.
Oh, my God, Mama. Are you crazy?
Ma'am, what did you take?
I'm not telling. And I'm not crazy.
I still have all of my mental faculties.
But not for long.
Cancer's spreading.
It's in my brain, baby, and I am not sticking around for that.
Blood pressure's 80/40. She's in the danger zone.
Looks like an opioid overdose.
Prepping naloxone.
That won't be necessary.
Or legal.
It's a do-not-resuscitate order.
With signed verification from my doctor.
No lifesaving measures, no medical intervention.
It's all there.
Advanced directives.
Don't listen to her.
D-Do whatever you have to do to save her!
No. You can't save me.
Just...
delaying the inevitable.
Why the hell did you call 911 if you didn't want help?
I called them for you.
So you wouldn't be alone when I go.
Mom, if you don't want me to be alone, don't do this.
We don't know how much time you have left.
It could be months.
I don't care if you're sick.
I want that time with you.
I want all the time I can get.
This isn't living.
It's suffering.
And I'm not talking about me.
I see what this is doing to you, and...
I don't want to do it anymore.
Legally, aren't we obligated to render aid at this point?
We-we can't just stand here and let her...
The DNR is clear.
Legally, we shouldn't do anything.
I-I'm sorry, our hands are tied.
Fine. You can't do it.
I will.
No. No, no.
You gave up your entire life to take care of me.
Well, now it's time for me to give it back.
I can't.
Shh.
I'm not leaving you.
I am setting you free.
When you have your own kids, you'll understand.
Mama, please. I love you.
Oh, I love you, too.
This is the last thing I can do for you, baby.
So let me.
No.

Baby, I need you to call <i>your father, tell him</i> to meet me at the hospital.
Pulse is weak and thready. What did she take?
<i>-Uh, hydrocodone.</i> Pupils aren't responding.
<i>Hi. This is May.</i> I'm right here. Can you hear me?
<i>-It's okay.</i> Hi.
<i>This is May. Leave a message.</i> Hey. Hey.
You, uh, talk to May yet?
Mm, keep trying, but she's not answering my calls.
Sending me straight to voice mail.
Sounds like things got pretty heated.
That girl hurt my child.
All bets are off.
She lucky all I did was arrest her.
Sorry if I can't just forgive and forget.
Well, they were kids. She barely knew better.
Oh, she knew what she was doing.
I don't get it.
Why would May want to have anything to do with her after what she put her through?
I don't know.
But I do know that you sometimes don't agree with May's decisions.
You didn't want her to take the job at the call center.
You wanted her to go to college.
I didn't want her to take that job because it's emotionally taxing.
Right. She has been keeping up with her counselor sessions. Seems like she's handling it.
And she's practically an adult now.
You don't have to like her choices, but they are her choices.
And if she says she's fine talking with Laila, maybe you just have to trust that she is.
That's the mistake I made last time.
I trusted that she was fine, and I almost lost her.
She was right here living under my roof, and I didn't know what was going on.
I was so wrapped up with me and Michael and the divorce that I didn't even realize what was going on with my own daughter.
Well, she was a teenager at the time. It's their whole M. O. in life not to let their parents know what's going on.
When it happened, I assumed it was because of me and Michael splitting up, but it was about something I had absolutely no clue about.
None.
Right.
So you-you have to forgive yourself, Athena.
Do you know how many suicide calls I've been on where nobody had any idea? You can't take on that kind of blame.
I'm her mother.
I should have known something was wrong.
But I missed it.
I'm scared she hates me right now.
But I'm more scared that I'm gonna miss it again.
Morning.
I think I did a bad thing.
U-Ultimately good but still bad.
What are you talking about?
I found Nia's birth mother.
Her name is Evangeline Gonzalez.
She works here as a nurse's aide.
Karen, how did you find her?
And isn't that completely against the rules?
Uh, I may have hired a private investigator.
Look, I had to know.
The not knowing was killing me.
Killing you.
I had to know if Nia was gonna be okay.
And is she?
Single mom.
Struggling to make ends meet.
She got evicted.
She was living in her car with Nia.
People saw her, and they called child services, who placed her with us, temporarily, while she got her life back together.
That was January.
And then the pandemic hit.
Not an easy time to be trying to put your life back together.
She couldn't catch a break.
Unless you were willing to work at a long-term care facility.
Mm.
She's been here since June.
The residents love her.
And there's a day care down the street.
She goes over on her lunch hour to eat with Nia.
Every day.
Nia's gonna be okay.
Yeah.
We did the right thing, Hen.
You want to do this again.
I love Nia.
I will always miss having her in our lives.
But knowing that she's with a mother who loves her, that we helped to give them a second chance, I'm proud of us for that.
It's gonna hurt like hell every time we do this.
Yeah.
We're gonna love them like our own and then have to let them go.
But I guess we can take it.
I'm just tired of always fighting with her.
Mm-hmm.
She doesn't think I'm capable of handling anything.
Yeah. But she knows you have a good head on your shoulders.
Hmm? She's just being protective.
And I can't say that I blame her.
But you didn't act like a lunatic when I told you Laila reached out.
Right.
And I wasn't the one that found you either.
What difference does that make?
You know, when Harry called me that day, he said that you were sick, that you and your mom were going to the hospital.
By the time I got there, found out what really happened, it was all so...just confusing and scary.
But you were alive.
Exactly.
You weren't when your mother found you.
You weren't breathing, May.
She thought you were dead.
And she blamed herself for it.
Why would she think that?
They were her pills, May.
Pills that I told her to throw out.
Wait, you blamed her, too?
No.
We both said a lot of things.
Because we were scared.
And then we got past it.
We realized what was the most important thing, and that was just being there for you.
Yeah, not all this guilt and blame.
It was pointless.
I know you think that your mom is made of steel.
She's not.
And I'll never know what she went through when she found you.
And I'm kind of grateful that I never will.

Hey, did you and Albert eat?
Chim.
What? Who's ready to eat?
What did I miss?
You fell asleep while standing.
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm just so tired.
Yesterday I fell asleep while holding the baby.
On the toilet.
How do other people do this?
I don't know.
But I think we might need help.
Yeah.
And I think I know who to call.
I know it's a lot to ask.
Albert can stay with us as long as he likes.
Give you two your space.
And, honestly, I think John's kind of excited about having him around.
Well, life can be pretty boring when you're both retired.
And we're available for babysitting services any time you and Maddie need a night off.
Oh. Albert's medications.
I should grab them, too.
I'll take her.
Okay.
Grandma's gonna hold you while Daddy goes to pack.
Howard, uh, I'm not...
um...
I mean, your mother...
Would be so grateful to you.
That you took in her kid after she was gone, loved him.
Loved me.
You finished the job she started, and...
I'm not sure I ever said thank you for that.
We're family.
Nothing to thank me for.
Okay.
Oh, don't worry, Jee-Yun.
Grandma's got you.
I know it's been really hard, so...
if you're not ready, that's okay.
We don't want to make a big decision without talking to you.
It affects all of us, so...
we should decide together.

Family stuff.
Maddie's, what, our fifth baby this year?
And Alvin's wife is due next month. And I'm pretty sure that's what Jenny wants to talk to us about tomorrow.
Well, we'll figure it out.
We always do.
How come you and Don never had kids?
Oh.
Sorry. None of my business.
I have kids.
I have a floor full of 'em.
