Those were not screams of joy.
I know.
People are flipping out. Isn't it great?
I-I don't need to experience the kind of bowel-clenching fear that causes people to scream like that.
By the way, bowel clenching is another thing I'm afraid of.
Good. You can cross two fears off your list with one ride.
I don't want to do this.
All right, check it out.
There are two hot girls in front of us.
If we get out of this line, they will Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram our faces with #pussies.
I don't want to be a #pussy. Do you?
So you'd rather have me crap my pants than be humiliated in front of two complete strangers?
Absolutely.
Plus, they're hot.
So that's potentially thousands of strangers.

Both true, but it's also for our own good.

I've had to listen to people die before.
The silence after they stop talking is like no other kind of quiet.
The guy who fell... all he had to do was grab my hand, and I couldn't get him to.
You know, believe it or not, there are some people who actually take those moments as opportunities to make that decision.
I mean, there are some people who just don't want to be saved.
Um, thank you for calling me.
Maybe I can call you again sometime?
Yeah, that'd be great.

How many times do I have to say this?!
You need to say it more because I do not believe you.
Seriously? It's got to be a jumper?
He couldn't threaten himself with a gun?
Right. 'Cause that would be preferable.
<strong>Officer ( <em>over radio</em> )</strong>: Bedroom door is locked.
The girlfriend is on the living room balcony.
We're gonna have to do The Maneuver.
Oh, Bobby, no, I...
Yes.
I'll do it.
No, Buck's got this.
You got this.
Why did you move in if I am so terrible?
You're not that terrible. Will you please get down so we can talk about how you can improve?
I don't think I need to improve.
Fine. You want to jump?
Go ahead and jump!
I don't even know what to say to him anymore.
Telling him to jump is probably not the way to go.
He will not listen to me, okay?
He's convinced that I cheated on him, and we keep going in circles.
Don't you dare do that, I swear to God!
Did you cheat on him?
This is the right time for that?
So, that's a yes.
No, it isn't.
Just tell him you're sorry.
Absolutely not.
Okay, I'm not gonna admit that I cheated on him.
It doesn't have to be true.
He just needs to hear that you're sorry.
All right?
Fine. Leonard?
I'm sorry.
Okay, I don't know what I was thinking.
I love you and only you.
You lying b¡tch.
Oh, fine!
I mean, that was pathetic.
Oh, come on, I tried my best.
Hey. Leonard, listen to me.
We've all been there, man.
I had a girlfriend cheat on me and...
I thought she was the one, Leonard.
I saw us going the whole way.
Marriage, kids, all of it.
So I went out and I bought her a ring, a nice one.
I mean, we were on top of the Eiffel Tower.
I got down on one knee.
I popped the question.
Everybody staring at us.
She had tears in her eyes.
You know what she said to me?
( <em>Softly</em> ): Now.
She says to me, &quot;Bobby...&quot;
( <em>Leonard grunts</em> )
( <em>Gasps</em> )
( <em>People applauding, cheering</em> )
What did she say to you?
Who?
The girl, on the Eiffel Tower.
I don't know. We never get that far in the story.
Hey, Bobby, um... thanks for pushing me back there.
I don't know what happened.
I guess I had a moment.
You bounced back and saved a man's life.
You did good, kid.
Five bucks says that guy's getting laid tonight.
( <em>Hen laughs</em> )
A guy ready to kill himself, and you think his girlfriend is turned on?
He was punishing her for cheating.
Guilt sеx. Help me out here, Buck.
I need to apologize to you.
I was completely out of line at the memorial.
You didn't deserve that.
You lost your brother.
I get it.
Seven years ago, Devon tried to kill himself.
We sent him to therapy and he got better.
Then, two months ago, he started isolating himself again.
Wouldn't leave the house.
I got scared and called his friend, Chad.
Begged him to get Devon out of the house.
Chad said he'd ask Devon to go to the state fair.
When Devon said yes to the fair, I took it as a sign that he was getting better.
So, you see, it's not your fault he's dead.
It's mine.
Look, there was nothing either one of us could've done for Devon.
Some people just don't want to be saved.
A friend said that to me recently.
And, um... it helped.
♪
Mmmm, well this is nice.
We don't get to go out very often, do we, Mom?
Mm-mm. Carla got me all dolled up.
Yes, yes, I did.
Mm.
<strong>Carla</strong>: It's good to get different kinds of stimulation.
Releases that serotonin, that happy hormone.
Well, we could all use a little happy hormone.
Abby, you're in the prime of your life, girl.
You need to get out and have some fun.
You need to ask out that fireman that looks like he got punched in the eye.
I'm not asking out that fireman.
He's way too young for me.
Girl, you are a hot spice pumpkin latte.
You're sitting around, getting cool, and there's a big old hunk of man that would love to burn his tongue on you.
Oh.
( <em>Laughter</em> )
Mm-hmm?
( <em>Whispering</em> ): Call him.
You're so pushy.
Mm-hmm.
But you like it.
Okay, I'll be back.
Wait, I want to hear this.
No.
( <em>Phone vibrating</em> )
Hello.
Hey. Buck, it's, uh, it's Abby Clark.
Ah, hey.
Hey. How you doing?
I'm good. Hey, can I ask you a question?
Sure.
How old are you?
Oh, my God, why?
( <em>Chuckles</em> ) 'Cause you keep calling me.
People don't use their phones to make calls anymore.
You know, we text, we Snap or we Marco Polo, or if it's really serious, then we FaceTime.
( <em>Laughs nervously</em> )
I guess that's true, I know I'm... sorry, I just, you know, I spend so much time on the phone.
I guess it's my most comfortable form of communication.
Nah, don't be sorry. I like it.
It's, um, it's old-fashioned.
Yes, well, um...
I have another old-fashioned idea, which is that I was thinking maybe we could... meet up in person over some old-fashioned margaritas.
Ah, see, where I'm from, they, uh, they call that a date.
( <em>Laughing</em> ): Yeah.
They call it a date where I'm from, too.
I'm asking you out on a date.
Um, I mean, that sounds really fun.
You're-you're super smart and funny and obviously killer at your job, um, but I'm-I'm realizing that I have some issues when it comes to women and intimacy.
And if, uh, if we went out on a date, I'm pretty sure we'd have sеx.
Uh, okay.
You think I would just sleep with you?
I'm not sure what to make of that.
No, look, it's, um, it's not you, it's, it's not you, it's me.
( <em>Chuckles</em> ) Um, look, I have issues.
For example, I just slept with my therapist in our first session.
It's kind of like I'm a magnet.
Oh, so you think I'm not gonna be able to control myself around you?
Because, right now, I mean, in this conversation, I'm extremely not interested in sleeping with you, so...
I won't go out with you because I like you.
'Cause I know we've only talked a couple times, but talking to you makes me feel really good and safe and curious about life because I can tell that you're special.
And I don't have anyone like you in my life and I don't want to do anything to risk losing you.
For now I think it's best if we just talk on the phone, like in the olden days.
I'd be into that.
That would be great.
All right, well, then I'll talk to you soon.
Bye, Buck.
Good-bye, Abby.
He said no.
<strong>Carla</strong>: Then why are you smiling?
Because I had the nerve to call the guy.
And sometimes the right kind of no is better than the wrong kind of yes.
I like that.
( <em>Sighs</em> )
( <em>Exhales loudly</em> )
Hey, baby.
How was your day?
Mm.
Great.
Good.
Oh. Dad called.
He said we could eat dinner without him.
( <em>Chuckles</em> ) I'll bet he did.
Where's your sister?
In her room.
Ooh. May!
Honey, you hungry?
May, honey, have you eaten anything?
Damn headphones with that music up so loud.
Hey.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
May. May. Oh, God.
