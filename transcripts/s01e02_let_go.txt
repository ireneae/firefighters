<p><strong>Devon</strong>: Did you hear that?</p>
<p>Those were not screams of joy.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>People are flipping out. Isn't it great?</p>
<p>I-I don't need to experience the kind of bowel-clenching fear that causes people to scream like that.</p>
<p>By the way, bowel clenching is another thing I'm afraid of.</p>
<p>Good. You can cross two fears off your list with one ride.</p>
<p>I don't want to do this.</p>
<p>All right, check it out.</p>
<p>There are two hot girls in front of us.</p>
<p>If we get out of this line, they will Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram our faces with #pussies.</p>
<p>I don't want to be a #pussy. Do you?</p>
<p>So you'd rather have me crap my pants than be humiliated in front of two complete strangers?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Plus, they're hot.</p>
<p>So that's potentially thousands of strangers.</p>

<p>( <em>Passengers screaming</em> )</p>
<p>Chad!</p>
<p>He's not moving. Send an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>Devon</strong>: Please, hurry!</p>
<p>Buck, we came in at the wrong angle.</p>
<p>I'm gonna have you climb up there, harness him in, and hang tight while we move the truck.</p>
<p>You think you can handle that?</p>
<p>Hell yeah.</p>
<p>This daredevil hero stuff is what I signed up for, Bobby.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>( <em>Woman crying</em> )</p>
<p>Help us! Please!</p>
<p>Everybody, try to stay calm.</p>
<p>We'll get you down, I promise, all right?</p>
<p>I need you to relax, I need you to breathe, and I need you to keep as still as possible.</p>
<p>You move less, you stay safe.</p>
<p>We get everyone off this ride safe.</p>
<p>( <em>Grunts</em> )</p>
<p>Hey, what's your name, man?</p>
<p>( <em>Panting</em> ): Devon.</p>
<p>Devon. All right, Devon. Well, hang on, brother.</p>
<p>( <em>Crying</em> ): Where's Chad?</p>
<p>What happened to Chad?</p>
<p>Hey, Bobby, he's asking about his friend.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby</strong>: Chimney, it's Captain, you copy?</p>
<p>Copy, Captain. What do you need?</p>
<p>How's the kid on the ground?</p>
<p>He's gone.</p>
<p>We lost him.</p>
<p>All right, I don't need the people up there seeing that.</p>
<p>So, do me a favor...</p>
<p>He survived, right?</p>
<p>Get him on a gurney. You know the drill.</p>
<p>Copy that.</p>
<p><strong>Buck</strong>: Hang in there, guys. We're coming.</p>
<p>I'm almost there.</p>
<p>What happened to Chad?!</p>
<p>He's dead, isn't he?</p>
<p>Hey, Devon, look at me.</p>
<p>Chad... He's getting help. You see?</p>
<p>He's gonna be fine.</p>
<p>And I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, all right?</p>
<p>Is everyone okay?</p>
<p>No, we're not okay!</p>
<p>Why is the fire truck going away?</p>
<p>It's just getting into a better position, that's all.</p>
<p>Devon, how we doing?</p>
<p>It's gonna be everywhere.</p>
<p>It's gonna be all over the place.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Forget about them, okay? You don't look down.</p>
<p>You look up at me.</p>
<p>You see this strap here?</p>
<p>All you got to do is reach up your arm, slide it through the loop.</p>
<p>( <em>Grunts</em> )</p>
<p>I can't!</p>
<p>Yes, you...</p>
<p>I can't!</p>
<p>Yes, you can, buddy. You can do it.</p>
<p>Come on, Buck. Come on, Buck.</p>
<p>Can you tell them to stop recording, please?</p>
<p>I don't want everyone to see me like this.</p>
<p>Listen, Devon, I need you to concentrate.</p>
<p>Please! ( <em>Whimpers</em> )</p>
<p>Slide your arm through the loop... and then we can deal with everything else.</p>
<p>( <em>Grunts</em> ) All right.</p>
<p>Hey. Reach up your hand. Come on.</p>
<p>It's, like, three inches. You can do this. I got you.</p>
<p>Devon.</p>
<p>Devon, I need you to trust me.</p>
<p>Give me your hand.</p>
<p>I will not let you go.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>Devon. Devon, please.</p>

<p>This is America, Buckaroo.</p>
<p>Eating has nothing to do with being hungry.</p>
<p>Man, I was right there.</p>
<p>You know, all he had to do was reach up and grab my hand.</p>
<p><strong>Chimney</strong>: People do funny things at times like that.</p>
<p>Sometimes they just freeze up.</p>
<p>I've never lost anyone before.</p>
<p>Does it get any easier?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Look, people die, and that's part of the gig, right?</p>
<p>See, your problem is, you're looking at every job like it's a long-term relationship.</p>
<p>They're one-night stands, man.</p>
<p>In that moment, they mean everything to you, but once the morning comes... it's on to the next one.</p>
<p><strong>Hen</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>You guys don't mind, I brought some company to family dinner.</p>
<p>Athena's going through some, uh, some stuff at home, so she could use some TLC.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby</strong>: Well, we don't usually allow cops at secret firehouse meetings, but, uh, I'll make an exception.</p>
<p>Mm. All right. Appreciate that.</p>
<p>Oh. Well.</p>
<p>You know, I ain't sold on you yet, but...</p>
<p>I think keeping me from getting shot deserves a second chance.</p>
<p>Hey, there won't be a third, though.</p>
<p>( <em>All laughing</em> )</p>
<p>Buck here is having a little trouble moving on from a call that didn't go his way.</p>
<p>Oh. You know why they make us wear these uniforms, right?</p>
<p>Cops, firefighters, paramedics?</p>
<p>Uh... sеx appeal?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>So people can easily identify us.</p>
<p>Both true, but it's also for our own good.</p>
<p>Because when we take the uniform off at the end of the day, it symbolizes letting go of all of the sad, crazy, inhumane things we've seen that day.</p>
<p>I see his face every time I close my eyes.</p>
<p>That happen to you guys?</p>

<p><strong>Buck</strong>: I reached out to pull him out the car.</p>
<p>Buck?</p>
<p>He wouldn't give me his hand. I don't know what happened.</p>
<p>I-I don't know why he would do that.</p>

<p>Okay. It's okay.</p>
<p>It's okay. My husband's a handyman. We'll handle it.</p>

<p>Ms. Clark? Hi, my name is Carla Price.</p>
<p>It's very nice to meet you.</p>
<p>I need you to unlock this door for me.</p>
<p><strong>Mom</strong>: I can't. I don't know how.</p>
<p>Okay, if you're on the floor, I need you to stand up and walk to the door.</p>
<p><strong>Mom</strong>: I'm up.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>

<p>You're a hero, too.&quot;</p>
<p>And... he needs help, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, he's got so much pain in his face.</p>
<p>Everybody's treating him like a hero.</p>
<p>He doesn't feel like a hero.</p>

<p>We-we talked the other day after the home invasion.</p>
<p>I was the 911 operator.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, you were badass.</p>
<p>Uh, how'd you get this number?</p>
<p>Oh, well, it was in the report.</p>
<p>Um, but, anyway, I just, I don't know, I wanted to check on you.</p>
<p>I've been seeing you all over the news, and it seemed like maybe you were having a hard time.</p>
<p>Yeah, um, how'd you know?</p>
<p>Uh, in my job you kind of learn how to read people just based on the sound of their voice.</p>
<p>Thank you for noticing.</p>
<p>Um, everywhere I go now people are patting me on the back, and I just want to scream back at them, &quot;You know, people died. I had to watch them die.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Abby</strong>: I know.</p>
<p>I've had to listen to people die before.</p>
<p>The silence after they stop talking is like no other kind of quiet.</p>
<p>The guy who fell... all he had to do was grab my hand, and I couldn't get him to.</p>
<p>You know, believe it or not, there are some people who actually take those moments as opportunities to make that decision.</p>
<p>I mean, there are some people who just don't want to be saved.</p>
<p>Um, thank you for calling me.</p>
<p>Maybe I can call you again sometime?</p>
<p>Yeah, that'd be great.</p>
<p>You have my number now or you can just dial 911. ( <em>Laughs</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles</em> ) All right, uh, well, thanks and let's talk soon.</p>
