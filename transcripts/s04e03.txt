Almost like they're covered in a film.
Cataracts don't just appear overnight.
What was that?
<strong>Hen</strong>: What?
Thought I saw something move.
In my eyes?
Something like a... a worm?
Oh, God. Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up.
I'm gonna throw up.
Just try and stay calm for us, okay?
<strong>Hen</strong>: Let me grab a forceps and a sample jar.
Worm? How did a worm get in my eye?
Maybe it could be some kind of bug.
Face flies.
It's a type of parasite that infects livestock.
They feed off the tears, lay eggs in the eyes.
You don't normally see it in people, though. Mostly cattle.
<strong>Becky</strong>: I haven't been around cattle.
I don't think I've even been in the same room with a burger since 2004.
You probably haven't taken a trip.
Everything's closed.
Maybe something in your workspace.
What do you do for a living?
I teach yoga.
What kind of yoga?
Good, guys, now transition from plank to tabletop.
Really focus on keeping that core engaged.
(<em>goat bleats</em>)
Nice.
Great form.
Hold your form.
Be one with the goat.
Keep that core engaged. Nice.
Really breathe in this nature around us.
Excellent, you guys.
Really breathe through that stretch.
(<em>tense music</em>)
And people pay to do that?
Well, people say that baby goats offer the perfect weight and resistance to hold a plank position.
I can know weird stuff too.
(<em>laughs</em>)
<strong>Becky</strong>: No, it's not weird.
Okay, it's a little weird.
But people really like the class, and... and goat yoga's the only thing that's keeping me afloat while the studio's closed.
Hey, no offense, but if you're gonna stick with goats, you might wanna consider wearing goggles.
Maybe it's a sign.
My sister keeps telling me to grow up already and get a real job.
She might be right.
Or she might be wrong.
Who cares what other people think?
Okay, if goat yoga is your jam, your dream, then own goat yoga.
Never apologize to anyone for that, okay?
Aw.
Thank you.
<strong>Hen</strong>: Oh...
Easy, easy, easy now.
I still have a tool that can make this whole blindness thing permanent.
Stay still. It's only gonna take a second.

Didn't expect to see you here this late.
Yeah, well, um.
I've been feeling pretty under the weather this week, and I can't let myself fall behind.
What are you doing here?
I have a, uh, thoroughly annoying lab partner that constantly makes me feel like I'm failing before I've even had the chance to try.
I guess I'm so used to pushing myself, I just assumed that everyone else has the same level of intensity.
Sorry.
See? There it is.
It's such a specific and precise way of insulting me.
I don't mean to, but I can't fail.
You wouldn't understand.
You...
You think I wouldn't?
You've been in the field for years.
Practically doing the job, probably saved hundreds of lives already.
I'm a Black lesbian that joined the fire department at 30, that started med school at 40.
You think I've ever walked into a room and not felt like I had to prove that I deserved to be there?
(<em>soft apprehensive music</em>)
Sorry.
For real this time.
You're on hormone replacement therapy?
Most people just assume I'm trying to quit smoking.
Most people aren't paying attention.
The headaches, nausea, increased irritability.
Or at least I hope it's increased.
Could all be a reaction to the patch.
Not much I can do about it.
Just gotta grit my teeth and push through.
Or you could talk to your doctor.
You might do better with the tablets.
Or if you're worried about blood clots, there's always the gel.
Um...
I have the BRCA1 gene mutation.
So six weeks before medical school started, I had a double mastectomy and RRSO surgery to remove my ovaries and fallopian tubes.
That is why I have the patch.
You're 20.
What doctor...
Oh.
Trust me, it was hard to find one who'd perform the surgeries on someone my age who doesn't already have children, but you know me.
I love to fight.
That's a pretty aggressive move, even for you.
(<em>solemn music</em>)
My mother died when she was 34.
My grandmother when she was 32.
That's why I push myself so hard.
I don't just wanna be the first woman in my family to graduate medical school.
I wanna be the first one to live...

No, Maddie. We're gonna be a family now.

It's so weird.
Dr. Heller said that she could tell.
Wait.
You didn't look while you were in the office?
We've been apart for so many firsts in this pregnancy, and I wanted to have this first together.
Hold on.
Could it be?
Oh.
<strong>Maddie</strong>: Oh, yeah, yeah.

Hi, sweetheart.
<strong>May</strong>: Hi.
Sorry I missed dinner.
Ah. No, you didn't. Saved you a plate.
Oh, really? Awesome.
You're pulling overtime already, huh?
No, I had a counseling session.
Did you have a rough call?
<strong>May</strong>: No, it's just a precautionary thing.
Because of my age and my history.
Sue said that it would be good that I meet with a counselor every other month.
I didn't know you told them about the suicide attempt.
<strong>May</strong>: I didn't see the point in lying to them.
It's on their records. You did call 9-1-1.
Yes. I did.
So I told them, and Sue said it wasn't disqualifying, but she just wanted to make sure I had someone to talk to.
Well, that's smart.
I'm glad she's looking out for you.
<strong>May</strong>: Yeah, me too.
It's just, I spent the whole day talking to people.
Last thing I wanted to do at the end of it was talk some more.
Yeah, but that won't go on forever once they see you know how to handle yourself.
<strong>Bobby</strong>: But there's nothing wrong with seeing somebody forever.
In this line of work, you... You have to have somebody to talk to.
I've got my meetings, your mother's got Dr. Sanford.
Oh, had Dr. Sanford.
I mean, Kara was great.
I would absolutely see her again if I needed to.
You stopped seeing her. When?
Um... few weeks ago.
You didn't say anything.
Um, I'm sorry. It just didn't occur to me. My sessions with Kara were to prepare me for going back out on the street, and now I am.
No, these sessions were for more than that.
After everything that you went through...
<strong>Athena</strong>: Your heart is in the right place, but I don't need anyone to baby me.
Never have and never will.
So if I'm your daughter, shouldn't that mean you don't have to baby me?
<strong>Athena</strong>: Well, you're only half mine.
Your daddy's side still need looking after.
Then maybe 50% less.
This is not &quot;Let's Make a Deal.&quot;
You're gonna be my baby forever.
Baby girl Han.
I guess we're gonna have to get serious about finding a name now.
Should we do something traditional or more modern, like &quot;Chicago.&quot;
You were right.
We are gonna be a family, the three of us, and I don't wanna keep hiding this from you.
Look, I told you, you don't have to protect me.
You're not the one I'm trying to protect.
