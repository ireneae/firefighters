You're 20.
What doctor-- Oh.
Trust me, it was hard to find one who'd perform the surgeries on someone my age who doesn't already have children, but you know me.
I love to fight.
That's a pretty aggressive move, even for you.
My mother died when she was 34.
My grandmother when she was 32.
That's why I push myself so hard.
I don't just wanna be the first woman in my family to graduate medical school.
I wanna be the first one to live...
Past 35.
<i>♪ ♪</i> Then we'd better get to work.
<i>♪ ♪</i> Yeah, we got him good.  Thanks, Buck. Real funny.
Yeah.
You're welcome.
You're late.
It was, like, 20 minutes.
Sorry.
I guess I'm just excited.
Me too.
But, uh, everything went okay, right?
Yeah. Doctor says I'm fine.
Baby's fine.
Okay.
It's just-- you know, you seem so worried lately.
And you know, like, we're in this together, right?
If there's anything wrong, you can tell me.
I'm not gonna run again.
I know that.
And I promise, if it had anything to do with you, I would tell you.
No, Maddie. We're gonna be a family now.
I'm here for you. Whatever you need.
Okay.
So what I need is for you to play this DVD.
Yes.
Let's go watch the greatest movie we ever made.
Yeah.
This is amazing.
That's our baby.
I'm sorry you couldn't be at the ultrasound.
Nah, it's okay, this was worth the wait.
I see we still can't tell the sex.
Guess the kid's shy.
It's so weird.
Dr. Heller said that she could tell.
Wait.
You didn't look while you were in the office?
We've been apart for so many firsts in this pregnancy, and I wanted to have this first together.
Hold on.
Could it be?
Oh.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I think-- Oh...
It's a girl.
Hi, sweetheart. Hi.
Sorry I missed dinner.
Ah. No, you didn't. Saved you a plate.
Oh, really? Awesome.
You're pulling overtime already, huh?
No, I had a counseling session.
Did you have a rough call?
No, it's just a precautionary thing.
Because of my age and my history.
Sue said that it would be good that I meet with a counselor every other month.
I didn't know you told them about the suicide attempt.
I didn't see the point in lying to them.
It's on their records. You did call 9-1-1.
Yes. I did.
So I told them, and Sue said it wasn't disqualifying, but she just wanted to make sure I had someone to talk to.
Well, that's smart.
Yeah, me too.
talking to people.
Last thing I wanted to do at the end of it was talk some more.
Yeah, but that won't go on forever once they see you know how to handle yourself.
But there's nothing wrong with seeing somebody forever.
In this line of work, you-- you have to have somebody to talk to.
I've got my meetings, your mother's got Dr. Sanford.
Oh, had Dr. Sanford.
I mean, Kara was great.
I would absolutely see her again if I needed to.
You stopped seeing her. When?
Um... few weeks ago.
You didn't say anything.
Um, I'm sorry.
It just didn't occur to me.
My sessions with Kara were to prepare me for going back out on the street, and now I am.
No, these sessions were for more than that.
After everything that you went through-- Your heart is in the right place, but I don't need anyone to baby me.
Never have and never will.
So if I'm your daughter, shouldn't that mean you don't have to baby me?
Well, you're only half mine.
Your daddy's side still need looking after.
Then maybe 50% less.
This is not "Let's Make a Deal." You're gonna be my baby forever.
Baby girl Han.
I guess we're gonna have to get serious about finding a name now.
Should we do something traditional or more modern, like "Chicago." You were right.
We are gonna be a family, the three of us, and I don't wanna keep hiding this from you.
Look, I told you, you don't have to protect me.
You're not the one I'm trying to protect.
