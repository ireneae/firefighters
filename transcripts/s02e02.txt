(indistinct chatter) TEENAGE MAN: (whistles softly) Wow.
This is way nicer than the place we stayed at last night.
FATHER: And it's central to everything we're here to see.
GIRL: Disneyland?
That's a little bit further, but Harry Potter's right over that hill.
Yay! I want a wand.
MOTHER: Can we afford this?
I'm using reward points we've been saving since before Kat was born. We're good.
She's my emotional support dog.
And by refusing me entry, you are violating federal law and risking me having a panic attack.
(barks) That's a baby.
So, the prize for winning the tournament was a trip to the regional championship in Reno.
The prize for losing in the first round is all the pancakes you guys can possibly eat.
(laughter) All right, so why don't you head on down to the restaurant while I get us checked out?
Yup.
Pickens, you come with me.
A recruiter from Duke is coming to see you when we get back.
North Carolina? I don't know.
After seeing that campus at UCLA...
Oh, you mean the California girls all over it?
Look, it can't hurt to listen to what Duke and Stanford and what every other top school who's gonna try and recruit you has to say.
Whatever you say, Coach.
All right.
That's my guy. What's our motto?
Heart of a champion.
That's right.
(laughs) Still cleaning the rooms.
I guess that's what we get for arriving at checkout.
Who's hungry?
Me.
(laughs) Come here.
Ooh.
* (cell phone chimes) (elevator bell dings) * Ali. Come on in, hon.
Can't apologize enough for making you cool your heels in the lobby.
Been a crazy morning.
You know, I had to close the Miami deal, conference call with the money boys in Dubai and I'm still operating on Dallas time. (laughs) I swear, sometimes I forget where I am.
Every city starts to look the same to me.
You know, the inside of another luxury hotel suite.
So show me what you got.
Okay.
So, based on what we discussed, I have gone back to a more Mediterranean vibe for the townhouses.
Oh, yeah.
(cell phone ringing) Oh, yeah, this is...
this is terrific work.
Do you need to get that?
Nah, it's just my wife.
MOTHER: There's a walking tour that shows where they filmed old movies.
That'll pack them in.
I need to pee.
Oh, you know where it is, honey?
Yeah, I can find it.
Okay.
She okay?
Yeah, yeah. I can see her.
She likes feeling grown up.
WOMAN: The toast is touching the eggs.
Now there's gluten in my eggs. This is all wrong.
Paisley.
Now see? You've upset her.
She's gluten intolerant, too.
Ugh. Paisley.
Paisley! Oh.
Would you like some coffee?
Oh, no. No thanks.
How about a mimosa?
In the shower?
What? No.
What?
Are you out of your mind?
You are blowing this way out of proportion.
There is no proportional response to being asked by your boss to shower with him.
I'm reporting this to HR and the board.
We're a publically traded company, you pig.
HR is terrified of me and I handpicked every member of that board.
I'll invite them all to Sardinia on my boat and they will forget they ever heard of you.
I will destroy you.
Hi. It's okay.
(whimpering) Don't be afraid.
(rumbling) Kat.
(people screaming) Kat!
Whoa!
What the hell?
Earthquake.
(people screaming) Go!
Kat!
(whining) Dad!
Watch out!
Kat! Kat!
Kat!
Dad!
Paisley!
(barks) Oh, God!
Dad!
(screaming) Dad! Dad!
Pickens!
Coach!
(people screaming) (grunts) Kat!
Kat!
(electricity buzzing) Kat.
Kat!
(car alarms wailing) * Hey, Dad.
Yeah?
Hey, Dad, do you think dogs know they're dogs?
What do you mean?
You-you know, like, I'm a person and a dog is a dog.
Mm-hmm.
But do dogs just think we're bigger, less hairier, smarter dogs that walk funny?
Thank God for you, kid.
(bell rings) All right. You got to hustle up.
All right?
Love you.
Oh.
I love you, too, son.
Go to school, buddy.
You ever feel like you missed your calling, Cap?
What are you thinking?
Michelin-rated restaurant or short order cook?
CHIMNEY: I was thinking TV chef.
I mean, what you do, it's like performance art.
Mm-hmm, and much like watching cooking on TV, we never get to taste anything.
Usually by the time it hits the table, the bell goes off.
BOBBY: All right, speed round.
If you weren't doing this, what would you be doing?
Fighter pilot. Topgun. Call sign: Shogun.
(laughs) What about you, Hen?
Editorial cartoonist, The New Yorker.
I have a lot to say.
You draw?
No, it's a dream. It's not supposed to be attainable.
Topgun? You can barely drive, you rebar head.
Hey.
All right, Buckaroo.
If you were not a member of the LAFD, what would you be doing?
Uh, I don't know.
I'm not getting fired, am I?
That's inevitable.
He'd be a golden retriever.
No, a bartender. No, no, no, bouncer at a bar.
A bouncer at a strip club.
CHIMNEY: What.
HEN: What.
What's going on with you, kid?
Just traffic sucks in this town unless you're driving ten tons of engine with sirens.
It took me almost two hours to get from Abby's place to the call center downtown, then back over here.
Just told Maddie she needs to start Ubering.
How's your sister settling in down there?
Well, she's a Buckley.
Practically running the place.
Here's how shadowing works.
I talk, you listen and hopefully you learn something about being a dispatcher.
Questions? Save them for after my state-mandated, ten-minute break which will be in three hours and 12 minutes.
First thing, everybody lies.
Dr. Gregory House was right about that.
Sometimes they know that they're lying.
"Oh, I had no idea that this would happen.
I just slipped and fell on that cucumber." Other times, whatever they're experiencing in the moment is scrambling their brains.
They are the ultimate unreliable narrators.
Uh, who's Dr. House?
You're one of those, aren't you?
A reader.
The point is you can't trust people, only yourself.
If it sounds like bull, it probably is.
(phone ringing) 911, what is your emergency?
WOMAN (over phone): I'm having chest pains.
When did the pain start?
911, what is your emergency?
MAN: I was playing pinfinger and I really messed up.
There's a knife impaled in my hand.
I-I got to get it out.
No, don't pull it out. Just leave it right there.
You would think after 14 seasons of Grey's Anatomy that people would know this stuff.
How bad is it bleeding?
MAN: It's gushing.
Okay, the EMTs are on their way.
So, questions? No?
Good, then it's your turn.
Wait, my turn to take a call?
See one, do one, teach one.
FYI, this is the middle part.
I'll be here like training wheels.
(exhales) (phone ringing) 911, what is your emergency?
MAN 2: Help, please. Can't breathe.
What is your location, sir?
Ocean Park and Lincoln by the sushi place.
(under breath): Sushi restaurant at Ocean Park Boulevard and Lincoln Boulevard.
Um, are you having tightness in your chest, pain in your arms?
N-No.
Throat's swollen.
Do you have any allergies?
Shellfish.
I told them.
Okay, it sounds like you're having an allergic reaction.
Help is on the way now.
Can you elevate your legs?
(car engine revs) Uh, no.
Sir, are you out on a street?
Parking lot, in my car.
Okay, what kind of car are we looking for?
Gray Challenger.
Help is on the way. Can I see that?
He could have been unconscious by the time the EMTs arrived because they would have had no idea where to find him.
Because you were so busy with your checklist, you didn't hear the sound of the engine running.
I understand. I've been an ER nurse for the last eight years.
People out there are in crisis, and we need to see it all, no matter what their panicked minds are telling us.
Because the only sense that we get to use to solve this problem is our listening.
I'm sorry, did you say something?
Listening. Oh...
Funny?
Yeah, so funny. Yeah.
I'm glad.
(sirens wailing) * * What you think about me * I won't try to argue * Or hold it against you * I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons * * The season is calling * Your pictures are falling down * Hold it right there!
* * Well, I guess this is growing up * Hey!
* Well, I guess this is growing up. * Where you planning on running, Marvin?
This is your house.
You know, if you're going to keep stealing cars, you might want to consider a less memorable hair color.
When I hear a felonious act, the suspect matches your description, I know where to find you.
This is the third time I've had to arrest you this year.
The hair is my signature.
All master criminals have one.
Yeah, all stupid ones.
I'm just getting all of my stealing done before I turn 18.
I'm joyriding, which is like borrowing the car without asking.
Only thing I steal is some gas from a tank, if you think about it.
Well, you're not going to juvie court this time, Marvin.
Ran from the police.
It's serious now.
Am I really going to jail?
Like, real jail?
You committed grown-up crimes.
Grand theft auto, evading the police, reckless driving.
You're lucky you didn't hurt anyone.
I'm not gonna make it to jail.
My mom's gonna kill me first.
(rumbling) (tires squealing) The hell?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
(gasps) Oh, my God.
(people screaming) Okay, that's at least a six.
Seven.
HEN: Get out! Get out, guys!
Come on!
CHIMNEY: Get out.
Get out. Get out. Go. Go.
Go, go, go, go!
Anybody else back there?
No.
(shouting over each other) Oh, my God!
Whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on.
(car alarms wailing) (exhales) Brace for impact.
(phones ringing) 911. What's your emergency?
911. What's your emergency?
911. What's your emergency?
(siren wailing) (electricity crackling) Is everything okay?
Yeah. There's no service.
Texts won't even get through.
Who you trying to get ahold of?
My son. I'm trying to reach my son.
BUCK: Whoa, you got a kid?
Christopher.
He's seven.
And super adorable. I, uh, I love kids.
I love this one.
I'm all he's got.
His mother's not in the picture.
He's at school?
Yeah.
Hey, I'm sure he's fine.
(horn honking) You guys ever deal with anything like this before?
No.
(woman shouting) I have to get back in there.
No, you have to let me back in there!
My baby's in there!
Please, our daughter is still inside!
She's eight years old!
No, my daughter's inside!
Kat. Her name is Kat!
FATHER: You have to let me in there!
She's all alone! Stop it!
They seriously think that's gonna hold it up?
Let's go find the incident commander.
Any word from Athena?
Haven't been able to get ahold of her.
What about you? Karen? Denny?
Same.
Cell phones are toast everywhere.
The system must be overloaded.
Captain. Chief Williams, incident commander.
Captain Bobby Nash. How can we help you?
Hotel manager said they were between checkout and check-in when the quake hit, so they were light on guests.
We've made contact with most of those.
Multiple evac operations in progress.
All but 12 of the 68 staff have been accounted for.
It's been pretty chaotic.
The family back there said their little girl is still missing.
As long as it's still safe to do so, we'll be looking for any survivors.
What do your engineers have to say?
Looks like we had a brittle failure in the prestressed concrete section of the building's underground parking garage, causing it to pancake at an angle.
Right now the reinforced steel is the only thing keeping it from completely collapsing. One good aftershock...
And the whole thing could come down.
A high-rise is supposed to be the safest place to be when an earthquake hits.
Not when you're built right on top of a fault line.
This quake was a 7.1.
Northridge was just a 6.7.
7.1-- that makes the largest in SoCal in 20 years.
And the last one was in Joshua Tree.
BOBBY: How many crews do you have in there?
Not enough.
We've put in a request for Heavy Rescue 3, but they're on their way to a freeway collapse.
We can use every hand we can get.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Okay, listen up.
Here's how you make it to the end of the day.
You don't worry about the things that you can't do anything about.
Focus on one task at a time.
I can't order you guys to go inside that building, and I'm not gonna judge you if you decide not to.
Hen, you got a kid, so...
Yeah.
And I'd hope if someone whose job it was to save him had the chance, they'd do it.
No matter what.
Where do you want us?
POLICE OFFICER: Hey.
You guys will want to see this.
CHIMNEY: We could set up a bag street-side in case that window gives.
Nobody works under that side of the building.
Somebody's gonna have to get him from the inside.
Buck, you say that's the 11th floor?
BUCK: I would.
I bet we could take the ladder to that fourth floor.
Cut the distance in half.
Head on up.
After Northridge, FEMA spent $200 million retrofitting every school in the LAUSD.
Ceiling tiles, lighting fixtures...
Eddie, your kid is in the safest place he can be.
Thought that was a high-rise.
MAY: I still don't have service.
MICHAEL: Neither does half of the people in L. A.
We can try your mom again later.
(horns honking) Come on.
MICHAEL: E-Excuse me.
Excuse me, I'm looking for my son.
The reunion gate station is located at the gymnasium, sir.
Okay.
MAY: Dad, I see him.
I see him, I see him!
MICHAEL: Harry!
Hey, Dad.
(panting, laughs) Are you okay?
Yeah.
Dad, did you see the school?
Yeah.
We probably won't come back for another month.
Isn't that awesome?
No, Harry, it's not awesome.
A lot of people got hurt.
And there's still some people missing.
MAY: You should try Mom again.
She'd want to know we have Harry.
Give me your phone.
Uh, still no service.
Wait, where's Mom?
She's working.
(indistinct police radio chatter) If you can drive, move your car to the shoulder!
Clear a path for emergency vehicles!
All your guys accounted for?
Fire and rescue's on the way.
Yeah, thank God.
All right, you need to get people out of their cars before the rest of this overpass comes down.
If they can be moved, move them.
If you're not sure, come and find me.
But mind yourself first. You want to be a hero, be the one who lives to tell the tale.
(man coughs) (man groaning) Sir. Sir, can you hear me?
Can you tell me your name?
Dean.
Dean? I'm Sergeant Grant.
There was an earthquake. You were in an accident.
But help is on the way.
Ah! I can't move, I...
I can't get out!
All right, enhance your calm, Dean.
We're gonna get you out of here as fast as we can.
(sniffs) DEAN: I smell gas.
Okay.
I smell gas.
(phone buzzing) Michael, Michael, are the kids with you?
Michael, you're breaking up!
MARVIN: Let me out!
You wouldn't treat a dog this way.
A dog would be more help right now.
Michael, Michael, are you with... Michael, you're breaking up.
Just tell me the kids are with you.
(phone beeps off) DEAN: Ah! Hey!
Hey! Help!
(Dean continues shouting) Ah!
How you doing, Dean?
I feel dizzy, and it's getting hot.
It's so hot.
Are those all the extinguishers you could find?
Underground gas line must have ruptured when the car hit the pavement.
We can't put the fire out with a constant energy source keeping it going.
It's like this car is sitting on top of a stovetop.
DEAN: Help!
Oh, God, please!
I don't want to burn.
Can't we cut him out?
He's jammed in there.
I need something bigger to cool this thing down.
(crying) The cement truck.
Who has the keys?
Miguel.
But-but he's helping people on the other side.
DEAN: Help!
Help!
Can you hot-wire that cement truck?
That's a 2004 Peterbilt 357 MTM...
I don't need the review from Car and Dumbass.
I need you to bring it over to that fire.
Can you?
I can hot-wire that bad boy with my eyes closed.
I'm giving you the authority to commandeer that truck and that truck only for official police business.
But if you run away, Marvin, and that man dies, your life as you know it will be over.
My life's already over.
You will wish you were in jail if you piss me off.
RESCUE WORKER: All right, we have to clear out!
DEAN: Please, God!
(crying) (grunts) Marvin!
(engine starts) Yeah!
I'm the king!
Push, push.
Push it.
Okay, hit it.
(sizzling) Come on, come on.
(Marvin grunts) All right, hold.
Passenger side.
You cooling down?
Yeah. Thank you.
All right. You hang in there, Dean.
Help's coming.
(panting) PARAMEDIC: Hey. Sir, we're gonna get you out, all right? Just stay calm.
DEAN: Okay.
MARVIN: Look at me, using my superpowers for good.
I feel like the Dark Knight.
Don't get carried away.
So we good? Can I go home?
That's up to the judge.
I just saved the day.
Doesn't that make up for the bad I did this morning?
Listen, I'll write a nice letter on your behalf to the judge.
Good deeds may get you into heaven, but the law is the law, honey, and once I put you in the back of my squad car, there's no getting out.
Thank you for helping me and that man today.
The next time you get a chance to do the wrong thing, think about how bad you feel right now, and how good it felt to do the right thing.
BOBBY: Watch your step, guys.
L. A. Fire and Rescue!
MAN (faintly): Can you hear me?
CHIMNEY: Is anybody down here?
Hello?
HEN: Bobby.
Yeah?
All right.
All right, guys, let's keep going.
L. A. Fire and Rescue.
CHIMNEY: Anybody down here?
COACH: Right here!
All right, we got a voice over there, guys. Let's go.
You need any help?
All good.
There's a kid maybe 50 feet back.
Needs EMTs bad.
HEN: Is it a little girl?
No, a young African-American kid.
Fire and Rescue. Hello?
COACH: Yeah. Right here!
Thank God, man, he's stuck!
BOBBY: All right, we're coming.
All right, guys, the floor is out.
It's stable.
(young man groans) Hey, he's stuck. Right here.
BOBBY: All right, help is on the way.
(groans) They're here, man.
Stick with me, right here.
What's your name, son?
Jeff.
Jeff? Hold on.
Hang tight. Jeff, we're right here.
BOBBY: Listen, you already try and move some debris, see if you can pull him free?
FIREFIGHTER: The second we touched the beam, the whole megillah above started shifting.
BOBBY: That's what I was afraid of.
All right, guys, this debris is holding up this section of ceiling.
If we try and pull this out of the way, this whole area could cave in.
(Jeff groans) HEN: You're gonna be all right.
Gonna be all right.
HEN: Just gonna stabilize you.
I-I can't move it, Coach.
How bad is it?
COACH: Hey, bones heal. All right?
You'll be all right. All right? Just a little setback.
You remember Paul George? Gordon Hayward? Huh?
I'm starting to think different about this California school.
Maybe it's not the place for me.
Yeah, Jeff has every division one college in the country recruiting him right now.
Sir, this firefighter is gonna lead you out of here.
No, screw that, I'm staying, all right?
This kid is a son to me.
All right? He's in my charge.
BOBBY: Okay, we need to focus all of our attention on Jeff right now.
We can't be worried about your safety, too. Now go.
I'm good, Coach.
Heart of a champion.
I love you, kid.
He's coming home with us.
(grunts) Easy, easy.
(Jeff groans) BOBBY: What do we got, Hen?
Tibia and fibula are crushed. Don't think the debris cut through any major arteries, though.
Okay, kid, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.
You're in a bad spot here.
We have two choices.
The first guarantees you get out of here, the second carries more risk.
What's the guaranteed way?
We get a trauma surgeon in here and we cut you free.
Free? You mean from my leg?
Yeah.
Listen.
We'd put you out. You wouldn't feel any pain.
You'd wake up in the hospital safe and sound.
Without my leg. No way.
I'd rather die here. What's the other option?
Well, we shore up this pocket we're in and then we get an air bag to lift up that beam that's pinning you down and we pull you free.
Yeah, yeah, do that. Air bags and all that.
All right, listen, I know that sounds simple, but it's not because this debris is holding up this ceiling and if it starts to give way, this whole side of the restaurant could collapse.
Me and my team, we're gonna be able to get out of here.
I don't think you will.
All right, man, you got parents, a girlfriend.
And they're gonna love you whether you play basketball or not.
I know. I know they do, but I worked so hard.
(cries) This is my dream, my whole life.
Look... I may be able to live without my leg, but I don't know if I can live knowing I could have saved it and didn't.
All right. We're committed.
We're gonna get him out of here.
Let's shore this up. Get an air bag.
Copy that.
As first responders continue the painstaking task of searching every floor of the hotel's 14 stories, experts fear that a significant aftershock could result in a sudden collapse.
ANCHOR: Well, we all remember how many brave first responders lost their lives on 9/11 when those buildings came down.
And that's the image that haunts the scene today, Martha, but that's not stopping the brave firefighters and rescue workers who continue to comb for survivors.
So much for the little training cruise.
Ladies and gents, listen up, please.
You've all completed a significant portion of your training.
The rest is gonna be a crash course.
All we're gonna be asking from you today is to basically roll calls.
More than 50% of what we're getting right now is nuisance calls, nonemergencies.
People telling us that they felt an earthquake, wanting to know when their power will be restored.
Your job today will be to keep the lines clear.
What if it's a real emergency?
If you think you can help, then do it.
If not, send it up the chain and one of us will.
All right?
My brother is a firefighter and I think he might be in that building.
We all have people we love out there.
The best thing we can do for them right now is our job.
(metal creaks and groans) EDDIE: It's only six flights.
Not exactly Mount Everest.
(panting): Yeah, except Everest might not tip over and crush you like a bug.
You good, Buck?
Yeah.
Let's keep going.
If you're not essential, get clear.
Okay. As soon as this thing inflates enough to pull him out, let's get him out of here.
You ready, Jeff?
JEFF: Yeah.
But if things go wrong, leave me and save yourselves.
This is my choice to try this.
All four of us are getting out of here.
That's right, with all eight of our legs.
Now, Jeff, Hen gave you some morphine, but when we move you it's still gonna hurt like hell.
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
Come on, we got this.
Yeah, come on, we the champs.
Yeah, we can do this, a'ight?
Let's go. We the champs. Heart of a champion.
We got this, we got this.
Heart of a champion.
Heart of a champion.
Let's do it!
All right.
Just like that. We got it.
Let's go.
In three... two...
one.
* Wading in the water * Just trying not to crack...
(Jeff groaning) He's not moving.
* Yeah, that's where we are, babe... * All right. Cap. Cap, it's not gonna hold.
It's not gonna hold.
Just a little bit more.
Just a little bit more. See if you can get him out.
Can you get him out?
(indistinct shouting) Go!
Go!
I got him! I got him!
(Jeff groaning) BOBBY: Get me dual grade. Watch the tip.
You're doing great.
Good job, champ, come on.
Heart of a champion, right? You're doing great.
You're doing great.
HEN: Come on, guys, get him up.
And on me, on three. One, two, three.
(Jeff groans) All right, easy.
You're doing great, champ, doing great.
Thank you.
All right.
Easy. Easy.
All right, easy.
All right, Chim, you follow.
Copy.
HEN: Hang in there, Jeff!
You got him?
BOBBY: All right, Trauma, he's coming your way, make sure he keeps that leg.
HEN: Come on.
BOBBY: Come on, Hen.
(grunts) Kat!
Kat!
* (grunts) All right.
You ready?
Yeah, on three.
One, two, three.
(grunting) EDDIE: Hello! Hello!
LAFD!
ALI: In here! In here!
HARLOW: In here!
ALI: Please.
This one here.
(grunting) (grunts) All right.
In you go.
Hello! LAFD!
We're in here!
In here!
(Ali whimpers) Oh, God.
(grunts) Thank God. Please, please, get me out of here.
Whoa, whoa, ma'am, I-I need you to just sit tight.
I will come and I will get you.
Okay?
Okay.
HARLOW: Uh, no offense, but I think this might be a situation where "women and children first" does not apply.
Did you just say "no offense"?
Everything about you is offensive.
First date?
Yeah, God, he wishes.
Amazingly, that sweaty, fat, pock-marked pig is married with five kids.
Didn't stop him from asking me to shower with him.
Man, have you not watched the news at all over the past year?
EDDIE: All right, you're good.
BUCK: All right.
Seriously, catch up with the times.
HARLOW: All right, fine, so I'm a dinosaur.
A forgotten relic of a forgotten age.
For God's sake, just get me the hell out of here.
Hurry.
I'm gonna throw you a rope, okay?
Okay.
I'm gonna need you to try and secure yourself.
Okay.
You ready?
Yeah.
All right.
(glass creaking) Don't move!
(grunts) Don't breathe.
(indistinct chatter) Wait a second. I remember him. I remember him.
He was in the restaurant.
I remember him. Go ask.
Did you find our daughter?
Did you find Kat? She was on the same floor as him.
We've still got people in there.
They're looking for her right now.
Somebody has to have seen her.
She was on the same floor as him.
Can you tell me what she was wearing?
She was wearing a pink shirt.
Pink.
It has ruffles on it.
Yes.
She has light blue jeans on.
Okay, sir, what kind of shirt?
Um, I don't know.
Button up?
It was like a, like a neck.
Yes.
Okay, what color were her shoes?
Uh, purple shoes.
Pink.
Pink? Were they pink?
Purple-pink.
All right, thanks. That is her shoe.
Parents said she was on her way to the restroom when the quake hit.
Restrooms are cleared, Cap.
HEN: Oh, my God. She could be anywhere.
She could be wandering about, trapped under this debris.
BOBBY: Let's get USAR back in here with thermal cams.
Hurry.
(glass cracking) Hurry, it's starting to crack.
All right, I'm gonna come around to you.
You need to stay totally still, sir.
Don't even talk.

Well, all hands on deck, right?
(Hen chuckles) Anything?
FIREFIGHTER: No, not yet.
HEN: Kat!
Kat!
Oh, God.
Please don't let this be the end.
All right. I'm gonna tie this webbing around you, and we're gonna get you away from the glass.
(whimpers) Okay. Okay.
(rumbling) Oh! Oh, God!
(Ali screams) Aftershock! Aftershock!
Help me!
HARLOW: Oh, God! Oh, God!
BOBBY: Chim, get outta there!
Get back! Get back! Fall back!
Chim, come on, Chim.
Hen, get clear!
(Hen screams) Hen!
(Hen screaming) Hen!
Hen! Hen!

ALI: Oh, no, my God!
Oh, God.
Hold on! Hold on!
No, don't!
(Harlow screams) (gasps) (heavy thud) (woman screams) Hey! Hey! Hey!
