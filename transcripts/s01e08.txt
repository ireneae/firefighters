DISPATCHER: Sir, are you there?
Sir, can you hear me Sir?
We've been here before.
Before you joined us, kid.
HEN: Chimney, you're almost there!
Coming. Coming. Coming.
Help me out here.
All right, watch her head.
Okay. Got it.
Why would she do something like this?
I'm sorry.
DANFORD: Whatever it was, we could have talked about it.
I could have helped her. I loved her.
I imagine she wasn't eager to run into your loving arms.
We had our differences.
Clearly.
Now, my wife liked to use this tree for target practice.
DANFORD: I'm not gonna ask you again.
Where were you last night? Do not walk away from me.
Hey!
You do this to yourself.
You realize that?
What do you want to hear, honey?
Huh That I screwed his brains out in the car?
Will that make you feel better for hitting me?
Why would you get a gun?
Don't take another step, Dan. I will shoot you.
I swear I will.
Well, look at you.
All brave.
Oh, I'm not brave.
I'm just so pissed at myself for letting you rip me away from my life and control me!
Pull the trigger.
Go ahead, pull the trigger.
Shoot.
Shoot, shoot, shoot! Damn it...
You want out so bad, you're gonna have to shoot yourself, not me.
DANFORD: Look.
It's still standing.
And she's not.
MAN: I really can't explain it.
Fungus took hold, spread like cancer.
Was she exposed to any foreign objects?
DANFORD: She got sick after being struck by a bullet.
MAN: That's weird. Tree this size?
Come on. There's nothing you can do?
MAN: Truth be told, she should have been leveled months ago.
It's a damn shame.
A lot of good memories with this tree.
Well, I can get you an estimate by the end of the day.
Don't bother.
* The bullet she fired at him...
Did it fly out of the tree when he blew it up?
Karma's a bitch.
* So I want to thank everybody for donating today.
I don't know if you know this or not, but 90% of all the blood given to patients in the Los Angeles area comes from volunteers.
I know that we all put our asses on the line in the field every day to save people, but today, you're saving people, and all it's taking is a tiny prick of a needle.
So simple, even Mr. Buckley can't mess that up.
How'd you do?
Incredible.
Everyone donated. Some people even came in on their day off.
That's great. All right, well, let's wrap it up.
We got to start our shift.
Uh, hold up.
Looks here like I am two pints shy of my goal for the day.
Well, that'll give you something to work towards next time.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're the captain of this house, and you're the only one who didn't participate.
I don't like needles, end of story.
Oh, come on. Captain, come on.
You got to donate.
I don't give blood.
All right? I never give blood. When I was a kid, they tried to take my blood, and I bit the doctor.
It's not funny.
And the one time someone tried to take my blood as an adult...didn't go well.
Bobby? Bobby, hold...Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
All right, listen, I get it. I really do, okay?
But I really need you to do this for me, all right?
Look...
I'm alive because that rebar hit my head at just the right angle, and because I had the best damn fire and rescue team to get me to the hospital and the best surgeons in the world once I got there.
But I got ten pints of blood, donated blood, given by the very generous people of this city.
Now, I told you, I just...
I wanted to do this blood drive 'cause I wanted to give a little something back of what I was given.
And expressing my gratitude like this-- it balances me out with the universe.
Now, you and everybody else here asked me how they could help with my recovery.
Well, this is how.
I hate all of you.
Thank you. Thank you.
You love us.
Here, you're gonna need this.
Just squeeze it.
CHIMNEY: All right, let's stick him!
All right, let's get it.
Hey. All right, get in there. Get in there.
There you go.
Mwah.
Hey.
I am proud of us.
What we're trying to do here-- I tell you.
And what is it exactly we trying to do?
Because I keep forgetting.
Well, be a family, for better or worse.
Adapt to our circumstance.
You know, everyone says that they put their kids first, but we are actually doing it.
I want to take the kids out this weekend.
Yeah.
Please. We've already taken them to your mother's.
Athena, I've been seeing Glenn now for some time, and I want the kids to meet him. I-I want you to meet him.
Absolutely not. They say you should wait a year before you introduce your kids to someone, and that's under the best of circumstances.
What, you think they're ready to see you sitting at dinner holding hands with another man?
Well, they need to see me for who I am.
Says who? Look, I know you're ready to come out and change your whole world, but the rest of us aren't.
God, it's not like he's moving in.
You know, I just thought that if we all go out for ice cream and maybe have a conversation...
And then what? Is he coming over for Sunday dinner?
Opening presents under the Christmas tree?
He's a stranger to us.
So I guess you want to have a background check before he's around the kids?
Couldn't hurt.
I met him on the Wilshire project.
He's a contractor.
Went to USC. He's decent.
Barely drinks.
Doesn't smoke, no drugs.
And I am hoping that's he's not a stranger for long.
We agreed that this family would change shape, and that we would work together to mold it into something that works for all of us.
I'm trying to move forward, Athena.
Move with me.
Then stop moving so fast.
Okay, so I came in early to turn in my keys and-and pick up my paycheck.
He actually fired me yesterday. It's a whole story.
Anyway, I, um...I smelled something burning.
We all kept trying to tell him to get it fixed.
Oh, my God. I didn't think to do that.
I don't know. He's the owner, so sometimes he comes in before we even open, so two hours, What do you think, Chim Worse. I think he's alive.
Why the hell didn't he just get out?
Might have had a stroke.
He's 32.
We need to know.
I don't know.
32, may have had a stoke; drugs could be an underlying cause.
He was stacking.
He's in V-tach!
Starting compressions.
CHIMNEY: No. He's gone.
Oh, my God.
Whoa, whoa. Easy.
It's just too freaky. I mean, after what happened with Mindy.
I told him. I said, "Barry, what goes around comes around." Who's Mindy?
(rock music playing over truck stereo) Barry. Hey.
You can't leave Mindy in there.
No, I won't be long. I'm just doing chest.
She's fine. I cracked the window.
Barry, it's not enough.
Why did you even bring her? Why didn't you just leave her home?
'Cause you know how hyper she gets.
She barks all day. The neighbors have complained.
I'm not supposed to have a dog.
Barry, she is gonna bake.
It's 70 degrees out.
PETA says on a 70 degree day, temperatures inside a parked car can reach a hundred.
Carrie, she's fine.
She's got water.
Barry, dogs can die from heatstroke.
And she's not your dog. You're supposed to be behind the desk.
* I always cross the line * Tightened our belts * Abuse ourselves * Get in our way...
Carrie.
What are you doing?
The tanning bed's fritzing again.
The timer's stuck.
No. I told you there's nothing wrong with it.
You just got to jiggle it.
Oh.
* What comes around goes around. * No, no, no. What the hell did you do?!
I saved your dog.
Here. You're welcome.
You know what?
You come pick up your final paycheck tomorrow morning.
You're fired!
Yep. Karma's a bi...
Please, don't.
This is Bobby.
I-I don't understand why you can't just tell...
Okay, thanks.
That was Cedars.
Is someone sick?
The blood I donated-- they sent it to a lab and had it tested, so...
Well, it's the first time you donated; they have to do that before they release it to the blood supply.
They found something in it.
What do you mean, "found something"?
They wouldn't tell me over the phone.
They said they'd rather do it in person.
BOBBY: I got to show you something, Father.
I haven't shared this with anyone else.
Your prayer book?
I guess it is my prayer book in a way.
A list of names.
62, so far.
62 of 148.
One hundred and forty-eight.
The number of people who died because of me.
These 62 names, these are people whose lives you've saved.
Yeah.
This job, it's the only way I know how to balance the ledger.
Not that I can ever really do that.
But 148 lives, I owe at least that much.
And then I can go.
Bobby, you're aware of the Church's position on suicide.
You're against it.
It would cost you your eternal soul.
I believe in God's justice.
How about his sense of humor?
There's something in my blood.
Something unusual.
The doctor wouldn't tell me over the phone.
He wants to break it to me in person.
I'm sorry.
So I guess the irony is, I may not live long enough to make it to 148, and that scares the hell out of me.
Because that is your penance.
And I don't know if my soul will ever be able to rest in peace if it goes unpaid.

I hope nothing was breakable in your package.
I don't know. I'm sure it's fine.
Not that you couldn't return it, but the hassle, you know.
Just get me to the hospital. Why aren't we leaving?
We're just not sure if you have a spinal cord injury, and so we're trying to stabilize you.
I told you, I can feel my legs.
I can feel it too much. It hurts!
The cops don't need to be here. I'm fine.
I-I don't want to go to the hospital.
You guys find I. D. on her?
Uh...
This must have fallen out of her pocket. Who called you?
One of the neighbors.
Are you trying to suggest that I'm...
There are days when I'd actually enjoy whatever tall tale you're on the cusp of spitting my way.
Where I'd be entertained letting you think that you're smarter than me, even if only for a minute.
But today is nowhere close to being one of them.
I'm the victim here.
I have to get to the hospital.
Oh, you'll get there.
They'll fix your busted hip.
Femur, actually.
And then you'll be charged with grand theft.
Trespassing, too.
Oh.
Your car is still running.
Your driver's license says you live in Van Nuys.
Now, I know you're in agony.
You want them to fix that femur in a timely fashion?
You cut the crap and confirm what I already know.
I don't keep anything.
I just like taking 'em.
I'm supposed to go to a rehab in Arizona, but they won't take my insurance.
(indistinct police radio chatter) Let me guess, if that bee in your bonnet had a name, it'd be Michael.
The guy he's seeing, he wants to start bringing him around, to get to know the kids, and I guess me.
Well, maybe that might be worth giving him a chance.
Hell no.
It might take away a little of the pressure.
Athena, look, I'm just saying this.
Maybe this guy is not all bad.
Michael has a okay track record picking 'em.
I wouldn't care if he's dating the Dalai Lama.
I know.
Michael being with somebody else is a hard thing.
What's hard is that somehow we done decided that's what's best for the kids is that we stay together and try to play happy, modern family.
All that means to me is that Michael gets to keep having the cake of living in my house and eating it, too, coming and going as he pleases.
As far as I can see, the only one doing any heavy emotional lifting here is me.
I'm the one who has to keep pushing my feelings to the side every day.
You got bigger problems than Glenn, Athena.
Kids love their daddies, but they follow their mother's lead.
No matter how good Michael is with those kids, if you hate him...they're gonna hate their daddy.
I know, relationship problems is going around, trust me.
You don't even want to know.
Guys, you think we can hit the road, please?
She's second-guessing everything I'm doing in here.
It's kind of hurting my feelings.
I'll call you later.
All right.
BOBBY: You don't have to be here with me, you know.
Yeah, well, this is all only happening because I'm the one who made you get your blood drawn.
I feel obligated.
Listen, I'm here for you, no matter what that doctor has to say, right Mr. Nash.
Yeah.
Thank you for coming in so quickly.
There are some findings in your blood work that are time sensitive.
He's good.
You can speak freely and directly.
No need to sugarcoat.
Please.
Have you ever heard of rhesus disease?
Uh, no. How bad is it?
It's terrible. Fatal in most cases.
But you don't have it.
It only effects pregnant women and their fetuses.
I'm-I'm sorry. I don't understand.
There are some 4,000 cases of rhesus in newborns each year.
You are almost an identical match to a man in Australia named James Harrison.
For decades, his donated blood saved the lives of more than two million children.
They call him the man with the golden arm.
Now, it seems you have one, too.
If you would fill this out.
We would love to get you into our rare donor's program as soon as possible.
We could set up regular donations.
There are babies at this very moment who need you.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
Well, dude, I guess you're gonna have to get over your fear of needles, huh?
We can't see the tigers, Uncle Sean.
They're hiding behind the tree.
All right, all right, all right. Hang on.
Okay.
SEAN: There we go.
ADAM: Direct hit.
Hang on. I'll get him moving.
Did-did you just throw something You're not supposed to taunt the animals.
We're not.
My-my nephew's just trying to get a picture, that's all.
Oh, uh...
Yeah. Yeah, that's the one I want.
SEAN: Uh, come on.
I got to take a leak. Let's go. Go.
Hey! Hey, what happened?
Hey!
What happened?!
Boys?!
ABBY: 911. What's your emergency?
He's, uh...he's just staring at me.
He won't take his eyes off me. It's-it's like he's...
It's like he's studying me. Th-This isn't good.
Zoo security's been alerted. They're on their way to you now.
Now's not gonna be soon enough, okay?
I've been on safari. I know how fast these things can move.
Sean, I'm being told your best course is to remain very still.
Sean, tell me what's happening.
Oh, God!
I made it! I'm in the, uh...the-the flamingo thing.
Tell the zoo security I'm in the flamingo thing, all right?
Oh, crap.
East side of the park.
Nowhere near where we're going. He's got a visitor pinned.
Shoot team's en route now.
You're gonna shoot him? That's just not right.
Protocol is to tranquilize first, if at all possible.
How did the tiger escape in the first place?
CARL: Apparently, he was able to jump to the top of the wall and gain enough leverage to pull himself out.
Tiger's trainer tried to wrangle him after he got loose.
This ain't pretty.
It's, uh...it's called degloving.
The-the cat actually peels the skin back with his claws.
Hen, saline.
Sir, we have to disinfect this wound.
How come it didn't just kill you I've known Kobe since he was a cub.
He didn't want to hurt me. He was just...
He was just confused.
Okay, if we're real careful, we can preserve the skin.
A little plastic surgery, you're gonna be good as new.
ABBY : All units responding to Barnsdale Zoo.
I have an adult male in distress, east side of the park.
He identified himself as Sean Coopertino, 47, of Riverside.
Says he's hiding near the giraffe enclosure.
Show 727-L-30 responding.
Can't be the same guy, can it? That'll just be too weird.
Same guy as what?
Sean Coopertino. The dentist from Riverside.
Dr. Coopertino, how much did you pay the illegal poachers?
You knew the area was a protected reserve.
Were you aware that Ellie was being tracked and studied by the University of Oxford?
I had no idea it was a protected reserve.
It was a legal hunting trip. Now leave me alone.
Cancel all my appointments.
Get my lawyer on the phone.
("You Oughta Know" by Alanis Morissette playing) Oh.
*
* Oh-oh, oh-oh * Oh-oh ABBY: Sean.
* You, you, you oughta know.
Oh, God. Sean.
SEAN: Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.
Stay where you are. Security has your GPS location.
They're on their way to you now.
Yeah, okay.
I, uh...I don't see it anymore.
I-I think I outsmarted it.
* SHARPSHOOTER: I got the tiger.
I don't see him. Do you?
I think I see him hiding back there.
ATHENA: I'm not so sure he's hiding.
Tranq him.
(indistinct police radio chatter) SHARPSHOOTER: Yeah, he's down.
HEN: That's a beautiful animal.
Chances are he's gonna have to be put down after this.
Maybe not.
Guess who he had for lunch.
Hmm?
That's that idiot that killed Ellie the Lion.
Mm-hmm.
I think public sentiment is gonna be with the kitty.
You know what karma is.
A bitch.
No.
She's a wild animal, and she won't be caged.
Hey. It's too quiet up in here.
Your dad's waiting on you downstairs with the Pictionary.
Are you on your way out to work?
Yeah, in a little while.
Are you guys having a hard time being with your dad?
No. That's your problem.
Uh, you know, what's going on with your dad and me is complicated.
What he's doing is...
is brave, and all of us need to support him.
Your dad and I are trying to keep this family together.
Why?
How is all of us being here, living with you and Dad mad at each other, helping our family?
Dad being gay was hard at first, but we love Dad.
That's not the problem.
So what is?
Making us fake it every day.
And for what?
So you two can pretend that you didn't mess up by marrying each other?
We prefer honesty.
Isn't that what you always taught us?
Hey, Bobby!
So, that guy in Australia, you know, the one with the same blood makeup as you, says here, in 1999, he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for saving those kids.
And what would be our equivalent?
It's got to be the Presidential Medal of Freedom, right?
We should, like, totally put you up for one of those, you know?
I mean, like, at some point.
I gave some blood, Chim.
It doesn't merit a medal. All right?
Let's just drop it.
It's the Presidential Medal of...
All right.
You want to tell me what's chafing you?
Look, I get it.
You don't like needles.
But you're a lifesaver; that's what you do.
You're a hero, man.
And somebody just told you you have the opportunity to save thousands, maybe millions of kids.
They're the wrong kids!
I want my kids!
Yeah, I'm some lifesaver, aren't I?
That's what I was put on this Earth to do, but I couldn't save my family.
Couldn't protect them from me.
A hundred and forty-eight.
That's the number of lives that I owe for the mistakes that I made.
And once I pay that debt, I get to be with them again.
And I was halfway there, Chim. I was halfway there.
I was going to see my kids again. That was the deal.
Deal with who, Bobby?
The deal I made with God.
I don't think it's God you made a deal with, Cap...
And I got that phone call about my blood test, and I thought, "Here we go. Here it is. Here's my punishment: cancer." And for all the prayers I sent up there, so I could live long enough...
You're not talking about killing yourself, are you?
Yeah.
I want out.
I want to see my kids again.
And I want this pain to end, but it's not gonna end.
It's never gonna end.
'Cause God's not punishing me by killing me.
He's punishing me by forcing me to stay alive.
Wait, wait, Bobby. Bobby.
ATHENA: Mm.
Something wrong with that cola?
Hey. Nah.
I keep a cooler in the truck for washing blood away from the scenes once we're done with them.
Cola is the only thing that really works.
It's not in the job description, but I feel like it's the right thing to do.
Victim was D. O. A., by the way.
Victim and suspect.
Guy robs the joint, and then gets hit by a dump truck a few feet from the store.
Hey, what was that thing you wanted to talk to me about?
Athena...
I messed up big-time.
Work or personal?
Personal.
Hmm.
Money or sex?
: Sex.
I slept with Eva.
The hell?
I thought your ex was still in prison.
Paroled, a few weeks ago.
I don't know what came over me.
It was, it was the night of that full moon.
I haven't been able to look Karen in the eye since then.
Well, you got to tell her.
I'm never gonna do it again. It was a mistake.
If anything, it just reminded me that I want to be with my wife.
I told you, I don't want to screw this relationship up.
Your relationship is screwed up already.
You don't cheat on a healthy relationship.
What you did is just evidence of how bad it is.
Now, your telling Karen is your chance at fixing it.
It's only when secrets are revealed that we know how good or bad a marriage is.
Now, trust me...
I know.
Sometimes you got to...
wreck it in order to save it.
There's a lot of love between the two of you.
Thanks, Athena.
Mmm.
And let me know how it goes.
Thanks for the cola.
Huh?
Oh. Hi, baby. What time is it?
Half past 11:00.
Mm.
We need to talk.
This is the hardest thing I've...
I've ever done, but I need to...
do it now while I still love you.
Okay. What is this?
The name and number of my divorce attorney.
Oh, no, Athena. No.
Whoever you get should call him.
Athena.
I love you.
: You're my man, the father of my children, my best friend.
This family...is changing.
It is what it is.
But us staying together like this, living in this house, holding on to some picture of what was...
: ...it's making me hate you.
If we don't really move on, that hate is gonna be the only thing I feel when I think about you.
Well, what about the kids?
I spoke to them.
This is what they want and need.
Ah.
I'm sorry, Athena.
I'm so sorry for hurting you.
I am.
I will never regret marrying you.
I would do it all over again, everything.
And to have those children and you as a friend, I would suffer all of it a million times.
* You're late.
I'm sorry. I was, I was...
just driving around.
I needed to, um...to get my mind right.
About Eva?
She's suing for custody.
That's impossible. Our-our lawyers said that...
According to her, we have an unstable home that's unsuitable to raise a child.
And she's saying the proof of this unstable home is that you slept with her.
Listen, baby, I-I'm sorry.
Let me just, let me, let me just, let me explain.
I'm gonna go pack some things.
I'm taking Denny to my parents'.
Let me just ex...
You put our family at risk.
I don't know what it is that you went there looking for, but I hope you got it.
And I hope it was worth it.
Oh, no, I didn't order this.
From the gentleman.
Oh.
Um...
Oh, God.
* I'm Aaron.
Um, Athena.
I hope you don't mind me sending that over.
Oh, well, no. I just...
: I just didn't realize that people still did this.
Sending drinks over to break the ice?
I'm pretty sure they haven't stopped doing that.
So how long have you been out of all of this?
Um...it's-it's been a while.
Recently separated.
Mm-hmm.
Two days.
We've been working our way towards it for a while now.
I mean, no hard feelings.
He's, um...he's at home with our kids, so I-I decided to, you know, just get out the house.
Went to a movie...and then I got thirsty.
I just didn't feel like drinking alone.
Mm.
I highly doubt that you being alone is anything you ever have a problem with.
Ooh. Well, aren't you Mr. Smooth?
I would've guessed that was your middle name.
No, no. It's, uh, Chester.
For real?
Oh, your parents hated you right away.
What's your full name?
Aaron Chester Brooks.
Mm. Date of birth?
April 18, 1980.
What are you typing?
Well, I'm a cop.
Sending it to one of my friends at the station, run a check on you.
Mm-hmm.
If we're gonna spend the night talking and drinking, I want to know I'm not wasting my time with a bad egg.
We can toast to that.
Hey, Chimney?
What's going on? You all right?
Uh...come on. I want to show you something.
Come on.
MAN: Her name's Asha.
She's our first.
Uh, this is Steven.
I told him I was bringing you by, and he begged me to let him talk to you.
Bobby.
We never thought we would get to meet her.
Instead, she's starting out life healthy and disease-free.
That's because of you.
That's your blood they rushed over here.
Thank you.
* You got the will of a wild * A wild bird...
Take care.
CHIMNEY: Now you tell me that's the wrong kid.
Look, you're gonna see your own kids again.
I do believe that.
But right now, Asha and a thousand others just like her-- they're your kids, too.
That's your blood in their veins.
So you look at her, you look at her and those young parents, and you tell me if that feels like a punishment.
No, Chim. It's a blessing.
Exactly.
I think you better either throw that book of yours away or get yourself a bigger one, 'cause it seems to me like you're here to stay.
Looks that way.
And just think, you'll only have to give blood once.
Every eight weeks.
For the rest of your life.
Oh, God.
Could you explain to me again how God's not punishing me?
Oh, he's just teasing you.
Yeah.
* You got some kind...
Considering who I work with, he must figure I can take a joke.
* You got some kind * You got some kind of love * You got some kind * You got some kind * You got some kind of love.
