(heart beating) (exhales) CHIMNEY: You're gonna be just fine.
Everything's gonna be just fine.
You're gonna be fine.
CHIMNEY: April, I've got two words for you: sleeved blankets.
Why would I want that?
Okay. So you're on the sofa watching TV.
And you get a little chilly.
So your wrap yourself up in a blanket.
But now you get thirsty.
You want to grab your glass, but your arms are under the blanket.
What do you do?
Take off the blanket.
What if you didn't have to?
What if the blanket had sleeves?
Now you can grab your glass, you can use the remote, talk on the phone, all while you're still snuggled up in your warm and cozy blanket.
A backwards sweater?
Eh...
Mr. Han, last month, you came in talking about fitness centers for children.
The month before that, it was...
what was it?
Pampered pet parties.
It's like an Avon lady, but with squeaky toys and rawhide.
Please stop.
I think you need to ask yourself what it is you want to do with your life.
I'm an aspiring entrepreneur.
Soon to be a financial mogul.
Made-up terms.
Eh.
Not a calling.
Well, this doesn't really feel like banking, April.
This kind of feels like it's therapy.
It's banking.
I'll see you next month?
* Hey, I got friends * * In low places * * Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases * * My blues away * Come on! Come on!
* I'll be okay * I can't hear you! Let me hear you!
* Hey, I'm not big on social graces * * Think I'll slip on down to the oasis * * Yeah, I've got friends * * In low places * (cheering) (whooping) Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
I will be here all week. Literally, here all week.
So if you want to sing a song, please come find me and give me your song selection.
But please remember, management has banned the singing of "Bohemian Rhapsody." (booing) * Lovely lady... * (sighs) Hi. "I Love Rock N' Roll." Please?
Joan Jett. Song 341. Nice choice.
Britney Spears.
Correction. Song 891.
You're Tina, right?
I've seen you here before.
My buddy manages the place.
I just help him out from time to time.
I'm actually an entrepreneur.
What kind?
Uh... venture capital.
I provide start-ups with enough money to get off the ground in exchange for a piece of their company.
Oh, wow. So you're an angel investor?
Yes. Yes, I am.
Sounds like you know a bit about business yourself.
I do. I'm actually studying business right now.
Right on.
(chuckles) Hey. Uh, shots are up at the bar.
She's all set.
What are you, flirting with the busboy?
(scoffs) I was being nice. It must suck to be him.
* Few times I've been around that track * * So it's not just gonna happen like that * * 'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl * * I ain't no hollaback girl * CHIMNEY: She asked me if I had a calling.
You need a calling for a small business loan?
That's what I said.
Well, so maybe sleeved blankets wasn't the thing.
I'm sure the next idea will wow them.
I think I'm out of ideas.
That bank lady's right. I got to find my calling, man.
I mean, seriously, shouldn't I have, like, by now, had some kind of moment where I felt like, "Yeah, this is it"?
This is the thing I'm supposed to do.
I don't think that feeling exists.
Most people just want a job they can stomach, that pays well enough, you know?
Decent hours...
I've been hustling since I was 16.
You know how many jobs I've had.
Probably over a hundred. Nothing's stuck yet.
Well, your first job stuck.
Babysitting me when you moved in with my family.
And you're still doing it. Bossing me around, anyway.
Yeah, that's because if there's one person I know with less direction than me, Kevin, it's you.
Yeah, you really been a terrible influence.
* Few times I've been around that track * What's Marco doing?
* 'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl * * I ain't no hollaback girl * (screaming) (siren wailing) ("Burning Down the House" by Talking Heads playing) * Watch out * * You might get what you're after * * Cool, babies * * Strange, but not a stranger * * I'm an ordinary guy * * Burning down the house. * Fire captain said it was a miracle that everyone got out alive.
Said there was a ton of code violations.
Like, that dance club in El Monte a few years back?
Similar situation.
12 people died, mostly from smoke and panic.
Well, thank God that didn't happen here.
Except it did. That one woman went up like a Roman candle.
Howie tackles her to the ground like a linebacker.
I'm small, but I'm fast, evidently.
(laughter) Everyone is just freaking out.
Everyone except Howie.
He's totally cool. I mean, he actually takes charge.
I've never seen him like this before.
(screaming) Get out the door and keep moving, out this way.
KEVIN: He starts guiding people out, keeping everybody calm, and he's got 911 on the line. It was incredible.
Through the door!
Howard? You're a hero.
I don't know about that, Mrs. Lee.
I just did what I felt I needed to do.
That's the very definition of a hero.
So I can expect rent to be late this month?
(chuckles) John.
What?
I'm glad it burnt down.
And that nobody got killed.
It's time you two got out of that karaoke dump.
Now you can both go out and look for real jobs.
Well, actually, Mr. Lee, uh, I think that "real job" just found me.
I applied today to join the L. A. Fire Department to be a firefighter.
Civil service.
And I feel like this is something that I've been called on to do.
Does that sound corny?
JOHN: It's a noble pursuit.
A man's decision.
Thank you, Mr. Lee.
You should call your father.
Uh, well, you know, the time difference with Seoul is tricky, so, uh...
I should wait to see if I make it through training and if I'm actually accepted first.
Howard, um, are you sure?
It's dangerous.
JOHN: Oh, Anne, you worry too much.
(clears throat) Actually, the recruiter said that the fatality rate's less than 0.3%.
So, statistically, we'd have to be on the job for over 300 years before we're likely to die in the line of duty.
We?
Yeah. I applied, too.
Are you out of your mind?
* THOMAS: You see this?
This is a Los Angeles firefighter patch.
You're all here because you want to wear one.
Membership into the world's elite lifesaving service must be earned.
Physically and mentally, you'll be tested as though your life depended on it.
Because that's the business we are in. Life and death.
Folks, this is not just another job.
This is not a hobby.
If you feel the slightest glimmer of doubt about your ability to make that kind of commitment, then I suggest you head back out that door.
* Left, left * Okay. This morning's training evolution.
A fire's broken out on the third floor of a five-story walk-up.
Ascend to the roof and descend to the third floor.
* Left, right, left * Three points of contact at all times!
Two hands, one foot!
One hand, two feet!
That's it, steady pace. Stay focused!
Jensen, take the door!
Come on, Lee, people are dying up there!
* Ever try to hold a lightning strike * The perimeter is your friend.
It will support you and carry your weight.
Everything else can and will collapse under your feet.
The most important rule of rooftop is never cross-country on impulse.
Remember science class?
Heat rises.
Move, let's go!
Here we go.
Come on!
That's it.
(chain saw revving) Stay focused!
Keep the pace! Keep the pace!
* The only one left * That's it! That's it! Move!
Work as a team!
(indistinct chatter) Make the cut!
Good job, Lee.
Good job, Han. Keep it up!
Moving in!
We're only gonna do this 20 more times.
That's it.
There you go. Let's go! Let's go!
As a team!
* Left, left, right, left * * They all fall down * * I'll be the only one left * * * The only one left. * Congratulations, cadets.
You are officially probationary firefighters in the Los Angeles Fire Department.
I have your assignments.
When you hear your house number, get in line.
Ashe, Martin. 133.
Han, Howard.
118.
Jensen.
122.
Lee, Kevin.
133.
Martinez, Jorge.
127.
I love this stuff.
Mm-hmm.
I didn't think you were gonna like that.
Hey, Eli.
You forget to tip the delivery guy?
(chuckles) That's funny.
Uh, I'm Howard Han. New recruit.
You're late.
I was told 6:30, sir.
Nobody wants their firefighters showing up on time, they want them early.
Yes, of course, sir.
(alarm ringing) Uh, where do you want me, sir?
Uh, take care of the table, then clean the kitchen and then the crapper.
(siren wailing) * (dispatcher speaking indistinctly) MAN: 118 en route. Five-car pileup...
DISPATCHER: All units...
KEVIN: It was crazy. This car, it hits the streetlight so the light goes out. It's completely dark.
We pull in there, we see the wreck, get the Jaws of Life, we pry open that car like it's a tin can, we got that little girl out.
DISPATCHER: Five-alarm fire downtown.
Multiple fatalities reported.
DISPATCHER: We have a jumper downtown on the corner of Spring and 2nd.
All units, five-car pileup, multiple injuries on the 10.
Please be advised, the wires are down.
Uh, power lines are in the street.
(mouthing) Flooding on the 101 highway.
Okay.
(grunting) Damn it.
(groans) KEVIN: Got to the building.
The fire was everywhere. People were screaming.
* (continues indistinctly) The fire started coming down.
We saved everybody.
It was amazing.
Howie? How was your shift?
(alarm ringing) Attention Station 118 units, respond to a traffic accident with injuries...
All units requested.
Attempted suicide at 11117 Hartbrook Street, in North Hollywood.
(echoes): Never supposed to pull the blade out, but I guess the guy panicked when blood started spurting everywhere. It was crazy!
Yo, how about the 118, Howie?
Uh, pretty boring stuff.
Uh, jumper, uh, five-car pileup, couple of gunshot wounds, you know, the usual.
(laughs) It's crazy, right? (laughs) (alarm ringing) DISPATCHER: All units report to the Los Angeles Forum.
Yes!
Multiple stab wounds, possible fatality.
No, no, I got it. Finish your meal.
Multiple car collision on the 5.
Several fatalities have been reported.
* You still here?
See what you can do about the floor, probie.
Yes, sir.
Yes!
Yay!
Come on! Come on!
Yes!
(horn honking) MAURA: Help!
Help me, please, somebody please help me, please!
Please-- please, it's my husband.
I think he's having a heart attack. Please.
When did the pain start?
Oh, uh, just a few minutes ago. And he said his chest hurt.
And now he's having trouble breathing.
My hands.
What's wrong with your hands?
Tingling.
Tingling in your hands.
Oh, this is very important, sir.
Do you feel the tingling just in your hands?
Or do you feel like it's running down your arm?
Hands. Just hands.
Got to get the seatbelt off of you.
Okay, sir, what is your name?
Dave.
Dave.
I'm gonna need you to breathe for me, all right?
I want you to slowly pull air in through your mouth for a count of four, hold it for one second, then out for a count of four.
You got me? Okay, breathe in, two, three, four, hold.
(wheezing) And out, two, three, four, hold.
You're doing great. Keep doing that, okay?
So, ma'am, um, what were you guys doing before the pain started?
Um, uh, we went to brunch and then we had a walk on the beach.
And he said he wasn't feeling well so I just drove us here.
Okay. Uh, Dave, you're doing really great.
Um, tell me about brunch.
Buffet.
Buffet. Right on.
Okay, and, uh, did you just have one thing?
Or did you have, like, a little bit of everything?
Bits of everything.
Bits of everything. Yeah, that's how you do it at a buffet.
Right? Little of this, little of that.
Before you know it, you've tried everything.
Um, don't you think you should use the paddle thingies and shock his heart or something?
No, I-I think he's doing better now.
Dave, do you feel like you're doing better?
Yeah.
I do.
I feel better.
Oh, the pain. (belches) Ooh.
See? It's just probably indigestion.
So you started to feel the pain in your chest, and then you started to panic, right?
Panic attack can look a lot like a heart attack to a layperson. I think you're gonna be fine.
Oh, God.
MAURA: You are my angel. Come here.
(laughs): Come here.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What about that burger place?
Tommy, I hate that place.
Hey, guys, weirdest thing happened today...
GERRARD: Hey, wasn't your girlfriend supposed to come and cook us dinner?
TOMMY: Uh, next Tuesday.
GERRARD: Promise?
TOMMY: Uh-- uh, yes. Yeah, I will promise...
(Skype ringing) Hello.
Howard?
Yep. It's your other kid.
Dad, I don't need money. I've got some news.
I got a new job. I joined the fire department.
It's not just fires, it's fire and rescue.
I save lives.
Right. Of course. You know what?
Sorry to bother you.
No, I'm okay, Pop. I was just calling to check in.
It's nothing...
(Skype beeps) Nothing important.
I thought it would be a good time to call Seoul.
It wasn't.
Your father...
I know.
He's a very, very busy man.
He's a jackass.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be calling him names.
No, no, no, no, no. I like where this is going. Please, continue.
Your mother, your mother was so vibrant.
So full of joy.
I just, I never understood how she ended up married to such a colorless man.
(chuckles) I miss her.
So do I.
She was my best friend.
If you and Mr. Lee hadn't taken pity on me after she died...
It wasn't pity.
We took you in because we love you, Howie.
You're family.
Then that's all I need.
(laughs, sniffles) * Hey, man, let's build a bridge here, huh?
Come on.
What about movies? I've seen them all.
Sports? I can tell the difference between a home run and a touchdown. Kind of.
TV, Broadway, classic literature, tell me what your thing is, and I'll make it mine.
Let's just be cool here, man.
You know, I'm told I have formidable people skills, but you just really don't like me much, do you?
If I thought about you at all, honestly, I probably wouldn't.
Suit up, Han. You're with me today.
I cleared it with the captain.
Yeah, but I'm not a paramedic.
I mean, you're not much of a firefighter, either.
But you can stay here and play butler or, you know...
No, no, no! Put me in the game, coach. I'm ready to play.
Fair warning, this is a "careful what you wish for" situation.
* (siren wailing, horns honking) Oh!
Where's it all coming from?
Worry about where it's going. Here.
(retches) * Well, I'm running... * Put pressure here, grab the tourniquet.
* Well, I'm running * * Police on my back * Turn his head, prevent him from aspirating.
Got to keep his airway clear.
* And the victim * * Well, he won't come back... * Oh-- oh! Oh, my God.
Come on. Latch it.
* Wednesday, Thursday, Friday * * Saturday, Sunday... * Focus, yank it.
Stem the blood loss.
This job is science meets rock and roll.
If we don't improv, people die.
* What have I done? * * What have I done? * Oh...
I'm dying.
You're not dying, sir, you're gonna be just fine.
* Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday... * ELI: You having fun?
I can see why they don't put this in the brochure.
* What have I done? * You're gonna be just fine, sir.
Ah, ah.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.
(sirens wailing) (dispatcher speaking indistinctly) Thanks.
It's not personal, you know.
Look, in this job, friends die and funerals are held.
They're not gonna just give you their friendship until you earn their respect.
They're not just protecting you, they're protecting themselves.
You don't name a puppy until you know it's gonna pull through.
Oh, so in this scenario, I'm a puppy?
There you go.
(laughs) You know, when I saw these guys, I just thought they're heroes; maybe I could be one, too.
When I saved that girl at the bar, for a second there I felt, maybe for the first time ever, not heroic, just...
useful.
I never saw myself old, with a family, so I figured, what the hell, live fast, die young.
Pull some folks through a burning building in slo-mo.
(laughs) Yeah, but that's only half the job.
I mean, when you come out of that building, you got to give 'em to me.
And if I let 'em die, then all that...
all that effort, all that risk, it was for nothing.
But that's why you became a paramedic?
It wasn't 'cause I liked the schooling.
(laughs) A few years ago, I pulled a ten-year-old third-degree out of a car fire.
Right? And I handed her off to some rookie M. D., who everyone said was a golden boy, and I watched him do everything wrong.
She died on that scene before we left.
Yeah, but for you, it's-it's not about the rush anymore?
You know, the thrill?
If that's the question you're gonna ask after that, I am sorry in advance for the lesson you're gonna learn.
(alarm ringing) DISPATCHER: Attention Station 118 units, respond to a structure fire...
We got a barn burner. Mount up.
You, too, probie.
Get in.
(sirens wailing) (heart pounding) (horn honking) MADDIE: Chim?
Metro, this is 118, on scene and in command.
MAN (over radio): Thank God you made it.
The fire is spreading quickly.
Sir, sir, it's like an inferno in there!
We need to get this ventilated. Let's move!
Finally.
Keep moving. We need to vent this fire out.
Look for weak spots so that we can cut through.
(indistinct chatter) (chain saw revving) All right, let's do it here!
Give me a hole right here!
Yeah, right there!
* Radio down, let's go.
All right.
THOMAS: The perimeter is your friend.
It will support you and carry your weight.
Everything else can and will collapse under your feet.
(coughing) (crying) CHIMNEY: Don't move! Stay right there!
Ma'am, stay right there, do not move!
Stay there!
CHIMNEY: No, don't move!
Don't move!
Don't move!
CHIMNEY: Stay right there!
(creaking) We'll come to you!
Right there, don't move!
Don't move-- stay!
Do not move!
Kevin, no!
(shouts) Are you okay?
(coughing) CHIMNEY: Mayday.
We got a firefighter who's gone through the roof.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
(continues indistinctly) Now!
I'm so sorry.
(crying) I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
(wailing) FIRE CHIEF (echoing): Throughout most of history, the lives of firefighters have been closely associated with the ringing of a bell.
As they began their hours of duty, it was the bell that started it off.
Through the day and night, each alarm was sounded by a bell that called them to fight fire and to place their lives in jeopardy for the good of their fellow man.
And when the fire was out, and the alarm had come to an end, the bell rang ten times to signal that end.
(bell rings) And now, our brother Kevin Lee has completed his task...
(guns firing) * (heart beating) THOMAS: Never cross-country on impulse.
ELI: Hey. It's good to see you.
Wasn't sure you'd be back.
Didn't have anywhere else to go.
(sirens wailing, horns honking) Officer, what do you got?
Shopping center expanding its underground parking garage, but somebody screwed up.
The entire floor collapsed in the biggest store.
Now, they're telling me it shifted down about three feet, but the floor is still there, just be careful where you step.
All right, people. Standard search and rescue. Let's move!
Cap, I'm gonna help Eli out.
Go.
Hi, I'm Howie. I'm gonna be checking you out.
How's your breathing?
Can you follow my finger?
This one's stable.
Squeeze my hand.
Headache? Let me check this out.
Okay.
Can you follow my finger?
And you don't normally get migraines?
Not even headaches.
And it started after the first floor collapsed?
Before, actually.
I think it's all the folding I do.
I work in the fitting room and no one-- and I mean no one-- ever folds their clothes.
MAN: Oh, my head.
You have a headache, huh?
Feels like a migraine?
Uh-huh.
ATHENA: All right, this looks to be the last of them.
Your captain's calling it.
I'm-a start sending over members of the construction crew.
Foreman's telling me a few of his guys have been hurling for the last hour.
Okay, thank you, Officer. Hey, Eli, you hearing this?
I'm getting vomiting and headaches.
Maybe they broke a gas main down there?
We'd be smelling it. The lines are intact.
Kinard. It's all clear.
Tommy, come in.
O'Conner. Where's Tommy?
He was right behind me.
* (heart beating) Officer, clear everyone back from this building!
I think it's a methane leak!
What does that probie think he's doing?
Move away from the building! Everyone, let's go!
Everybody move away!
Let's go!
(people screaming) Back! Back!
(grunting) * Wake * * From your sleep * * The drying of * * Your tears * * Today * * We escape * * We escape... * * Breathe * * Keep breathing * * Don't lose... * You still here?
* Your nerve * * You can * * Laugh * (screams) * A spineless * MADDIE: Chimney?
* Laugh * * We hope your... * CHIMNEY: I applied today to join the L. A. Fire Department to be a firefighter.
KEVIN: I applied, too.
* Wisdom * * Choke you now. * ELI: Hey.
Hey.
Part of the job is learning to love terrible coffee.
Tommy?
Resting.
Well, I got to say, for a guy who huffed gas and got dragged out of a burning building, he looks better than you do.
(chuckles) Yeah, well, the Ramada, this is not.
Shift starts in about an hour, I'll clean up at the station.
Hand it off, man.
Sorry?
You're gonna get hurt in this business.
You, me, them.
Hell, we all signed up for it, right?
We raised our hands and said, "Yes, please," to the burns and the broken bones, the cartoon bruises, two weeks without eyebrows.
Right?
But you know that's not the hurt I'm talking about.
You're right, this coffee sucks. (chuckles) The things that can't be treated with ointment and a splint are the things that'll kill us.
The guilt, the loss, the images...
We can't drink or sniff or screw them away.
Hand it off.
Kevin died, Eli.
And Tommy didn't because of you.
I know it's easy when the girl's on fire or the guy's bleeding out to think that we're God, but we ain't.
You got to let that ego burn away, man.
You are not that powerful.
Hand it off.
We treat the wounded, we hand them off.
These doctors, they do their job, they hand them off, to God or the universe, karma, wh-whatever the hell you want to call it. Hey.
But we hand them off so that we can pick up the next guy.
And at the end of the day, maybe ourselves.
Because if we don't...
We become the patients.
And the world has too many of them.
What it needs is more caregivers.
So...
Come on.
(groans) Go give care.
Right.
But first, better coffee.
(chuckles) And a decent breakfast, on you for the sage advice.
(chuckles) Right.
All right. You have your wallet, right?
Oh, you know, I think...
Ah, you have your wallet.
Sorry, buddy. (laughs) You got your wallet.
* Mrs. Lee, hi.
Hello, Howard.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you, too.
I'm so sorry. Here, please, come in.
I apologize. I'm-I'm just getting settled in right now.
I know it's a mess.
Uh, here, for your new home.
We wish you prosperity.
Thank you.
So, uh...
how's Mr. Lee doing?
(sighs) He couldn't come, not yet.
Please forgive him.
Forgive me.
But it's not your fault.
I'm the one who got Kevin into this. I'm the reason that...
I knew my boy.
When he was sad, when he was happy.
I had never seen him happier.
Being a firefighter, finally having something important to do.
All you did was help him find his purpose.
I don't know what I'm gonna do without him. (chuckles) He'll be watching over you, along with your mother.
Both of them so proud.
All of us, mm?
* Thank you.
Love Actually, monster trucks, craft beer.
(chuckles) So you're back?
How's that head of yours?
Still fat, but clearer.
You saved my life.
Thank you.
Thanks, Tommy.
ELI: Come on.
Somebody out here wants to talk to you.
Hi. Hello.
We just wanted to come here and thank you.
You're the reason that we're both alive.
Uh, so who do we have here?
This is Adam. Say hi.
Hi, Adam.
He still needs a middle name.
Oh.
Uh...
My name's Howie.
Oh...
Well, it's Howard.
You know what? I think I'm gonna have to earn some kind of cool nickname. "Howie's" just not gonna cut it, is it? (chuckles) (Adam fusses) You know, I think he looks like a Kevin.
(Adam coos) TOMMY: Paramedic, huh?
Damn good one.
(sirens wailing) * The bittersweet between my teeth... * ELI: We have a GSW five minutes out. Patient is stable.
Getting the bleeding under control now, just give me a second.
You need me to get in there?
No, I got it.
I'm dying!
Sir, you're gonna be just fine.
Bullet went straight through. It's your upper shoulder, and it's no veins or arteries. You're just in shock.
Just turn your head. One second. Okay...
(retches) Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.
You're gonna be fine.
* Fall back in love eventually... * You're gonna be fine.
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. * (insects chirping)
