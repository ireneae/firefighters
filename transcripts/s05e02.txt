How is it that every time the world seems to end, it ends some more?
"9-1-1" all new, Mondays.
This thing's hold on by a thread, Cap!
And watch other Fox shows, like "Our Kind of People," "The Big Leap," and "The Resident" on Fox.
<i>Medevac 305.</i> <i>Currently eight miles outbound</i> heading 07-niner with information whiskey.
Altitude 1,500 feet.
<i>Chopper 305,</i> <i>I'm heading up to the roof now. Over.</i> Roger that. Medevac 305 approaching the pad.
Medevac, I see you!
It's weird.
What's that?
The place where this heart's coming from, that was a tragedy.
But once we land, it's gonna turn into a miracle, right?
Yeah. I like that.
Miracle incoming.
Ah, I can't see the pad... Hang on!
Pulling up!
What the hell?
I've lost the whole tail rotor.
Hang on!
Generator should've kicked in automatically.
Something's wrong.
That came from the roof.
Let's go.
The generators will have to wait.
Window washing cables. This thing's holding on  by a thread, Cap.
 118, I want ropes, webbing and the heavy winch on the rooftop, double-time.
 We're not waiting for any of that, right?
 No!
First thing we do is get those rotors turned off.
Hen, Buck, you check that cabin and see what we got. Eddie, you're with me.
Kid! Can you hear me?!
Can't move.
Chim, this is Hen.
I need you to bring me a backboard and C-collar  from inside.
 Copy that.
Hang in there, kid, we're gonna put this fire out and then get you out, okay?
It's slipping!
 Help me!
 We're okay! We're okay!
We're okay. You're okay.
Wh-What's your name?
 Manny.
 Manny?
How long you been a paramedic?
 Been at it almost a month.
 Oh, wow.
You're lucky, Manny!
It was a while before I got to see any real action.
This ain't quite the action I was hoping for.
You're gonna be okay, kid.
Buck, let's get the pilot out of here!
Here.
Backboard!
 Hen, what do we got?
 Spinal.
I'm guessing cervical.
We need to flip him on this backboard.
 That's a two-person job.
 I'm available!
Trick is, how do we do that here?
The backboard's long enough to cover this opening.
 You're gonna flip me over the window?
 I know.
 It's not optimal.
 No, very not optimal!
Listen, it'll work. Strap him in.
We'll figure out a way to pull him out.
All right, flip him on three.
One, two, three!
 How you doing, Manny?
 Breathing's good.
Pulse feels right.
 Okay.
 I can move my fingers.
Not my toes.
That's good, Manny.
You're making our job very easy.
Thanks for that.
Good job.
Eddie!
Secure this to the board.
 All set, Cap!
 Okay, we're all set!
Go!
Wait!
The heart!
This is a transplant flight!
I got it.
Hen!
You worry about that later. Let's get him out.
Go, Hen, come on!
Get him up over that ledge!
Easy! Easy!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Feels like it's about to go, Hen!
Come on!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Looks like he's lost sensation in his lower extremities.
Possible spinal cord injury. He needs cold fluids right away.
Once we get the generators running, prep for a CT and put him in a cold OR.
 The winch is here, Cap.
 No time for that.
 Cap! Cap!
 Hold!
 Cap! Cap!
 Hold on! Hold on!
Whoa!
I got it!
Get him up top!
That was amazing.
Any chance you can do a transplant in the dark?
We'll get the generators running.
And I bet by the time we do, the city will have the power back on.

The one with the riding mower? You never even liked him.
Why are you...?
Michael, are you having a party?
No.
You know, it's more like a gathering.
Just a few neighbors.

All right, talk to you later, okay?
What'd I miss?
Did you give Harry this money?
Because that's something you've known me to do.
Spill it.
Okay, I may have been charging the neighbors to come in.
Just five dollars.
That's a deal considering what they get.
Electricity, all-you-can-eat food.
Harry Grant...
I want you to give every cent of this money back.
You hear me? We are not trying to turn a profit here.
But, Dad...
No, we are here to help people, okay?
Not take advantage of them in their moment of need.
That's not what good neighbors do, son.
Go now.
And pass out some waters while you're at it.
And don't charge anybody for 'em.
How can I help you, Officer?
My name's Sergeant Grant. I got a call over my radio that someone here was looking for me?
It was a little unclear.
 Sergeant Athena Grant?
 That's right.
I'm Dr. Zimmerman. Can you come with me?
He was brought in five days ago.
Some kids found him in MacArthur Park.
His throat was cut.
Looked like he'd been dumped there... no wallet, no I. D.
He lost a lot of blood, and we were able to repair the wound, but it caused a stroke.
We didn't think he was gonna make it.
This morning he came to long enough to write this.
Sergeant Grant, do you know this man?
Lou. Oh, my God.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
<i>You've reachedA the Los Angeles County Jail.</i> <i>Currently all representatives are busy.</i> <i>Please stay on the line for the next...</i>  Wha...?
 I'm still on hold.
What is taking so long?
The jail's computer systems are down just like everybody else's. They're doing a head count.
Five days, Elaine.
He's been in the hospital for nearly five days.
How is it that no one noticed that he was missing?
We were a little preoccupied with the world ending.
I should've checked in with him.
I should have... I should have followed up.
Why would you have?
The last time you spoke, he had Hudson in custody.
It was a done deal. You didn't have any reason to.
<i>Currently all representatives are busy.</i> He might not wake up again.
That's what they're saying.
<i>- Cap, are you there?</i>  Yes.
<i>Yeah, we swept the building... He's not here.</i>  You sure? <i>- We are sure, ma'am.</i> <i>Very sorry, I'll let you know if anything...</i> All right. Thank you.
<i>Yeah.</i> Jeffery Hudson's not in his cell.
 Son of a bitch!
 You were right.
He didn't even make it back to Men's Central.
He's still out there... And with a five-day head start this time.
Tasha, have you had any word back from Lila Risco?
 <i>Ot yet, Captain. Still trying.
 N</i>  I'll send a unit.
 No, I'd send more than a unit.
She was there when Lou took Hudson into custody.
There's a reason we haven't heard from her.

I know everyone loves breakfast for dinner,  but powdered eggs?
 We have a lot more mouths to feed than usual with the emergency recall procedure put in place.
You know the drill.
All shifts in the house until further notice.
Couldn't you stash some of the good stuff in the back of the fridge for the A shift?
Refrigerator is off-line and off limits starting this afternoon.
We've been running that generator 24-7.
 We got to cut back on our fuel use.
 Hey, Hen, you hearing this?
We're losing fridge privileges.
The hurt gets spread evenly around and no one's immune, I suppose.
Hey, can I borrow your charger? My phone's dead.
Oh, sorry.
This is my department-issued personal charging device.
And sharing is against protocol.
What?
Who issued you that?
I see someone hasn't met the power czar.
After a requisition form has been submitted, you will be issued a personal charging device.
Once it is dead, you return it to the probie charging pool, and it will be recharged for you.
You can just say Ravi.
Ravi will recharge it for you.
One charge per 24 hours is the limit.
Do not attempt to bribe me or you will be docked two charges.
Give me a charger or Uncle Buck will never see his niece again.
Give him the charger.
 Well-played.
 So let this be a lesson.
Never give Buck a clipboard.
Never.
Excuse me for being efficient.
That's one word for what you are.
Dad!
Hey!
What are you guys doing here?
We brought you food.
 Hey.
 Mwah.
You guys didn't have to do that.
It was Christopher's idea.
He kept saying how much he missed Dad  and thought you were hungry.
 Uh-huh.
So we've got bean salad, tuna salad, and this one is just, uh, <i>salad</i> salad.
Ah. Hey, Buck!
Oh, looks like the new chief is here.
How are you?
 Good. I'm good.
 Oh, Ravi, this is, uh, my son Christopher.
Chris, this is Ravi Panikkar.
You're a firefighter?
I'm what they call a probationary firefighter.
Did you do something wrong?
Constantly.
I'm Ana. Hi.
 Hi.
 You must be Eddie's wife?
Not yet.
So... even in the dark, this place is amazing.
Uh, you've never been here.
 Uh...
 No, I haven't.
Probie, you know, why don't you take Ana on a tour?
I'm gonna put this stuff up there and...
I don't want these things to wilt.
 Come on.
 All right.
I'll show you all around.
Come on, Chris.
Go, go, go!
All right, that's us, let's go!
Move, move, move! Suspect is a white male.

Go. In, go.
<i>- Aptain Maynard, house is clear.
 C.</i> <i>You're gonna want to see this.</i> Dead lawyer, dead end.
Well, her car's still in the garage, so he didn't take that.
Maybe he teamed up with one of those groupies.
No.
His only accomplice is right there.
You think so?
I do.
My mind just keeps going back to the visitor logs from Men's Central Jail.
The only name that appeared more times than his groupies  was hers.
 She was his lawyer.
Whom he fired and whose place he came straight to after he escaped.
I don't think it was to get a refund on his retainer.
You think they were lovers.
Bed's still made.
I think she was smitten just like the other fools.
I think she saw him being led away in cuffs and she intervened on his behalf.
We thought we were saving her.
I don't think she wanted to be saved.
So she attempts to murder a Los Angeles police detective to help him escape.
And he kills her for the favor? I mean, why would he do that?
Jeffery Hudson's not a one-woman kind of guy.
It's a little scary how deep inside this guy's head you are.
Not deep enough.
He's always two steps ahead.
A lot more than that.
Five-day lead... he could be halfway to Florida by now.
No, no, I don't think so.
A city plunged into utter darkness is exactly the place he'd like to be.
No better hunting ground for a predator like him.
No, I don't think he's gone anywhere at all.
In that case, maybe we need to warn his previous victims.
Actually, maybe we don't.
Maybe we don't warn them at all.

That's right, Mustafa was at the Greek Theatre.
And they got Sarabi and the cubs heading down Los Feliz towards Cahuenga.
I guess all mammals know to use the Franklin Pass.
No, I don't think you guys are hearing me. Okay, this is not me and Eddie bagging a turkey in South Pasadena.

I thought they were peaceful.
Any animal is peaceful, Cap, until it's provoked.
And alpacas... are pretty vicious.
It's called berserk syndrome.
And it's a thing.
You know a lot about alpacas.
Well, we were gonna get one.
He bit my ear off!
 I wouldn't.
 Not gonna.
We need to get it to move out of the way.
Maybe we can attract it with some food?
Reese's Pieces?
They eat mostly grass and grains, Cap.
All right, well...
You know, corn's a grain, right?
Worth a try.
Here you go.
All right.
Hey there.

Hey, are you sleeping or just pretending?
I was actually trying to, until you interrupted.
I'm exhausted.
Uh, h-how are you feeling?
Hot. I'm sweating out of places I didn't know I could.
Not like a cold sweat though, right? A-Any chest pains?
You don't give up, do you?
 I'm fine, Buck.
 People who are fine don't go and see cardiologists.
You need to tell me if something is wrong.
All right. It was a panic attack.
Not a heart attack.
Panic.
Since when do you panic?
That's what I said. I don't panic.
Except I did.
Okay, well, what triggered it?
I mean, you did just get shot and almost killed by a sniper. I guess that could be considered anxiety-inducing.
That wasn't it, okay?
If I'm being honest with myself, I think it was Ana.
Uh...
I thought things were great with her.
Yeah. She's been a godsend through all this.
Staying with Christopher, you know. But I...
I think that's what's causing the panic.
Somehow we became a ready-made family and I...
I don't know if I'm... ready for that.
So what are you gonna do?
I think I'm just gonna stick it out.
Ana's been the first woman I've wanted  to spend this much time with since Shannon.
 Stick it out?
That's not the way you talk about someone you're in love with.
My kid loves her.
Is that enough?
Eddie, I have been Ana.
I know what it's like to be in love with someone who is not all the way in.
Deep down you know it, and it hurts.
It hurts worse than the truth.
So if you don't want to hurt Ana, you owe it to her to be honest.
You know, it just feels like a lot, man.
Well, go to sleep.
You don't need to decide right now.
It's not like we're going home any time soon.
Hey, Maddie.
Uh, you're probably asleep.
Nothing to worry about.
I was just calling to say hey.
All right, call me when you can.
Love you.
Hey.
 Everything okay?
 Yeah.
I'm sure they'll be fine.
You don't sound sure.
Well, we've been on duty for days and Maddie is home alone in the apartment with a baby and no power.
Yeah, but it's Maddie.
She's been through worse than a blackout, Chim.
And she's always been able to handle herself.
Yeah, Maddie's not really Maddie lately.
She has postpartum depression.
It started a few months ago.
It's kind of been a roller-coaster ride.
No one knows?
No.
She already feels like a failure 'cause she's struggling so much.
So other people knowing would just make it worse.
So you're hovering?
Maybe, a little.
Probably a lot. I just don't know how to stop myself.
Chim, she's not your patient.
She's your partner.
She just needs you to love her and support her.
So stop trying to fix her.
Yeah.
You're right, it's Maddie.
She'll be fine.
If you think this is great wait till I show you the ocean.
Are you okay?
Okay, okay.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
So she's okay?
Lungs seem clear. 02 levels look good.
I don't think she inhaled any water.
And what about her head?
CT doesn't show any injury and I checked her head twice... No sign of a bump.
Thank God.
Now, obviously, I want you to keep an eye on her.
If there's any change in her breathing pattern, if she starts coughing or vomiting, bring her back immediately.
 I will.
 But...
I think she's gonna be fine.
How are you doing?
Shaky.
Just feel like the adrenaline's wearing off.
Then you should get her home.
I bet you both could use a good night's sleep.
I'll have the nurse have you discharged.
Thank you.
For everything. It's been a pretty terrifying night so far.
Well, probably not the last you'll experience before she makes it to adulthood.
And I speak from experience.
I feel like I age a decade every time one of my kids has an accident.
How was your day four?
Or are we in day five of this craziness?
Well, five, I think.
You know, lions, tigers blood-spitting alpacas on Hollywood Boulevard.
 The usual. <i>- How is it that every time</i> <i>it seems the world is ending,</i> it ends some more?
<i>Because it never actually does, just</i> keeps us on our toes.
More like knocks us on our asses.
<i>Yeah? How so?</i> I am sitting outside this woman's home, waiting for Jeffery Hudson to make a move.
And yet I haven't warned her.
Or the other victims.
<i>They're not helpless bait, Athena.</i> They are protected because you are there looking out for them.
That man stood in court the other day called me a rogue cop.
Here I am, fulfilling the prophecy.
<i>You are doing your job, and</i> <i>those women have been hurt enough already.</i> <i>Besides, there's a good chance he never even shows.</i> Is it bad that I hope he does?
I hope that for you too, baby.
<i>Bobby Nash.</i> Did you just say you hoped I come face to face with a dangerous escaped fugitive tonight?
I believe I did.
Well, that might be the sweetest thing you have ever said to me.
<i>I want you to be the one who gets him.</i> Except this time, don't shoot him in the leg.
<i>Oh, I'm gonna aim higher</i> and empty the clip.
Believe that.
Got to call you back.
I just got some very esteemed reinforcements.
<i>Be safe.</i> Well, this might be an LAPD first.
Don't think I've ever seen a captain on a stakeout.
That's why I left my bars at the station.
Captain, what are you doing here?
Eh, you know, one way or another Hudson is responsible for slicing up one of my guys and putting him on life support, so at this point, it's personal.
So I'm relieving you.
Respectfully, Captain thanks but no thanks. I'm not leaving.
Yes, you are.
Ransone is awake.
And he's asking for you again.
We were able to extubate him a few hours ago, but he hasn't been able to speak.
He's still got the pen and paper, though, which tells me the stroke hasn't significantly impaired  his cognitive abilities.
 That is good news.
I heard you were looking for me.
You save your strength, Lou.
But it is damn good to see you too.
Yeah, we found her dead.
Gunshot wound. Probably two days old.
I figured it.
I just put the pieces together a little too late.
I'm so sorry I wasn't there, Lou.
In the wind.
Again.
More like some hunches.
Maynard thinks he's probably long gone by now, but I'm not so sure of that.
I think that's our best chance of catching him.
We have surveillance units posted at all the victims' houses.
And we're waiting for him.
My house? What about it?
No, no, it's okay, Lou, it's okay.
You're victim too.
These people aren't leaving.
I should've let Harry charge them by the hour.
Guess you're regretting that "we're supposed to help" "our neighbors in their time of need" speech?
Yeah, well, technically, they're not  my neighbors anymore.
 Ooh.
Hmm?
No. Mom has to work until the emergency's over.
That's too bad.
I was really hoping to see her.
Athena?
Bobby, I'm on my way to the house, but I'm still ten minutes out. Can you get there before me?
<i>Well, I can try. Traffic is</i> <i>pretty clogged here by the firehouse.</i> Aren't Michael and David there with Harry?
<i>They're not picking up.</i> Bobby...
I was so worried about Jeffery Hudson going after one of his victims that I forgot...
You're one of them, too.
I'm on my way.
 Chim.
 What's up, Bobby?
Here, you're in charge. I'm taking the captain's truck.
I will explain later.
What? What's going on?
Elaine, I'm almost home.
<i>I'm five minutes away.</i> And I managed to get some units out there.
Do not go in there alone.
 I don't think that's an option. <i>- Athena!</i> The last time you went in without backup, it did not end well.
People keep talking to me about the last time.
I no longer have the luxury to dwell on that.
Michael? You here?
 Hands up! Don't move!
 No, no, no! Athena, it's me!
 It's me, it's me, it's me!
 Michael, what the hell?!
 I almost shot you!
 Yeah, I can see that.
Now, what the hell is going on?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Where is everyone? Why is the house so dark?
 I thought you had people here.
 The generator went out.
Everybody left.
Goes to show you who your friends are, right?
Ah! And let there be light.
Oh good. We're back.
Wait, did it just out of gas?
No, it was unplugged.
Someone must have kicked out a plug by accident.
Athena?
 Everything okay?
 He's not here.
Who's not here?
Would somebody mind telling me what in the hell is going on?
Michael.
Where's Harry?
Uh, he was just here.
Uh, there's his phone.
Residents only.
You're gonna have to turn around or show some ID.
Sorry about that, Detective.
We've had some reports of break-ins.
Can never be too careful.
