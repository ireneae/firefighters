Altitude 1,500 feet.
<strong>Nurse</strong>: <em>Chopper 305, I'm heading up to the roof now. Over.</em>
Roger that. Medevac 305 approaching the pad.
Medevac, I see you!
<strong>Manny</strong>: It's weird.
What's that?
The place where this heart's coming from, that was a tragedy.
But once we land, it's gonna turn into a miracle, right?
(<em>chuckles softly</em>)
Yeah. I like that.
Miracle incoming.
Ah, I can't see the pad... Hang on!
Pulling up!
What the hell?
I've lost the whole tail rotor.
Hang on!
Generator should've kicked in automatically.
Something's wrong.

That came from the roof.
Let's go.
The generators will have to wait.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Window washing cables. This thing's holding on by a thread, Cap.
118, I want ropes, webbing and the heavy winch on the rooftop, double-time.
We're not waiting for any of that, right?
No!
First thing we do is get those rotors turned off.
Hen, Buck, you check that cabin and see what we got. Eddie, you're with me.
(<em>coughing</em>)
Kid! Can you hear me?!
Can't move.
Chim, this is Hen.
I need you to bring me a backboard and C-collar from inside.
Copy that.
Hang in there, kid, we're gonna put this fire out and then get you out, okay?
It's slipping!

Help me!
We're okay! We're okay!
We're okay. You're okay.
Wh-What's your name?
Manny.
Manny?
How long you been a paramedic?
Been at it almost a month.
Oh, wow.
You're lucky, Manny!
It was a while before I got to see any real action.
This ain't quite the action I was hoping for.
You're gonna be okay, kid.
Buck, let's get the pilot out of here!
(<em>grunting</em>)
Here.
Backboard!
Hen, what do we got?
Spinal.
I'm guessing cervical.
We need to flip him on this backboard.
That's a two-person job.
<strong>Eddie</strong>: I'm available!
Trick is, how do we do that here?
The backboard's long enough to cover this opening.
You're gonna flip me over the window?
I know.
It's not optimal.
No, very not optimal!
Listen, it'll work. Strap him in.
We'll figure out a way to pull him out.
All right, flip him on three.
One, two, three!

How you doing, Manny?
Breathing's good.
Pulse feels right.
Okay.
I can move my fingers.
Not my toes.
That's good, Manny.
You're making our job very easy.
Thanks for that.
Good job.
Eddie!
Secure this to the board.
All set, Cap!
Okay, we're all set!
Go!
Wait!
The heart!
This is a transplant flight!
<strong>Eddie</strong>: I got it.
Hen!

Possible spinal cord injury. He needs cold fluids right away.

He was brought in five days ago.
Some kids found him in MacArthur Park.
His throat was cut.
Looked like he'd been dumped there... no wallet, no I.D.
He lost a lot of blood, and we were able to repair the wound, but it caused a stroke.

Five days, Elaine.
He's been in the hospital for nearly five days.

We were a little preoccupied with the world ending.
I should've checked in with him.
I should have... I should have followed up.
Why would you have?
The last time you spoke, he had Hudson in custody.

Just feel like the adrenaline's wearing off.
Then you should get her home.
I bet you both could use a good night's sleep.
I'll have the nurse have you discharged.
Thank you.
For everything. It's been a pretty terrifying night so far.
Well, probably not the last you'll experience before she makes it to adulthood.
And I speak from experience.
I feel like I age a decade every time one of my kids has an accident.

How was your day four?
Or are we in day five of this craziness?
Well, five, I think.
You know, lions, tigers... blood-spitting alpacas on Hollywood Boulevard.
The usual.
<em>How is it that every time it seems the world is ending,</em> it ends some more?
<em>Because it never actually does, just...</em> keeps us on our toes.
More like knocks us on our asses.
<em>Yeah? How so?</em>
I am sitting outside this woman's home, waiting for Jeffery Hudson to make a move.
And yet I haven't warned her.
Or the other victims.
<em>They're not helpless bait, Athena.</em>
They are protected because you are there looking out for them.
That man stood in court the other day called me a rogue cop.
Here I am, fulfilling the prophecy.
<em>You are doing your job, and those women have been hurt enough already. Besides, there's a good chance he never even shows.</em>
Is it bad that I hope he does?
I hope that for you too, baby.
<em>Bobby Nash.</em>
Did you just say you hoped I come face to face with a dangerous escaped fugitive tonight?
I believe I did.
Well, that might be the sweetest thing you have ever said to me.
<em>I want you to be the one who gets him.</em>
Except this time, don't shoot him in the leg.
<em>Oh, I'm gonna aim higher</em> and empty the clip.
Believe that.
Got to call you back.
I just got some very esteemed reinforcements.
<em>Be safe.</em>
Well, this might be an LAPD first.
Don't think I've ever seen a captain on a stakeout.
That's why I left my bars at the station.
Captain, what are you doing here?
Eh, you know, one way or another Hudson is responsible for slicing up one of my guys and putting him on life support, so... at this point, it's personal.
(<em>chuckles</em>)
So I'm relieving you.
(<em>exhales</em>)
Respectfully, Captain... thanks but no thanks. I'm not leaving.
Yes, you are.
Ransone is awake.
And he's asking for you again.
We were able to extubate him a few hours ago, but he hasn't been able to speak.
He's still got the pen and paper, though, which tells me the stroke hasn't significantly impaired his cognitive abilities.
That is good news.
I heard you were looking for me.
(<em>sobs</em>)
(<em>grunting</em>)
You save your strength, Lou.
But it is... damn good to see you too.
Yeah, we found her dead.
Gunshot wound. Probably... two days old.
I figured it.
I just put the pieces together a little too late.
I'm so sorry I wasn't there, Lou.
In the wind.
Again.
More like some hunches.
Maynard thinks he's probably long gone by now, but I'm not so sure of that.
I think that's our best chance of catching him.
We have surveillance units posted at all the victims' houses.
And we're waiting for him.
(<em>grunting</em>)
My house? What about it?
No, no, it's okay, Lou, it's okay.
You're... victim... too.
These people aren't leaving.
(<em>groans</em>)
I should've let Harry charge them by the hour.
(<em>chuckles</em>)
Guess you're regretting that &quot;we're supposed to help our neighbors in their time of need&quot; speech?
Yeah, well, technically, they're not my neighbors anymore.
Ooh.
Hmm?
(<em>laughs</em>)
(<em>indistinct chatter</em>)
No. Mom has to work until the emergency's over.
That's too bad.
I was really hoping to see her.
(<em>chuckles softly</em>)
(<em>phone ringing</em>)
Athena?
Bobby, I'm on my way to the house, but I'm still ten minutes out. Can you get there before me?
<em>Well, I can try. Traffic is pretty clogged here by the firehouse.</em>
Aren't Michael and David there with Harry?
<em>They're not picking up.</em>
Bobby...
I was so worried about Jeffery Hudson going after one of his victims that I forgot...
You're one of them, too.
I'm on my way.
Chim.
What's up, Bobby?
Here, you're in charge. I'm taking the captain's truck.
I will explain later.
What? What's going on?
(<em>engine starts</em>)
(<em>phone ringing</em>)
Elaine, I'm almost home.
<em>I'm five minutes away.</em>
And I managed to get some units out there.
Do not go in there alone.
I don't think that's an option.
<em>Athena!</em>
The last time you went in without backup, it did not end well.
People keep talking to me about the last time.
I no longer have the luxury to dwell on that.
Michael? You here?
(<em>glass breaks in distance</em>)
Hands up! Don't move!
No, no, no! Athena, it's me!
It's me, it's me, it's me!
Michael, what the hell?!
I almost shot you!
Yeah, I can see that.
Now, what the hell is going on?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Where is everyone? Why is the house so dark?
I thought you had people here.
The generator went out.
Everybody left. (<em>chuckles</em>)
Goes to show you who your friends are, right?
Ah! And let there be light.
(<em>exhales</em>)
Oh good. We're back.
Wait, did it just out of gas?
No, it was unplugged.
Someone must have kicked out a plug by accident.
<strong>Maynard</strong>: Athena?
Everything okay?
He's not here.
Who's not here?
Would somebody mind telling me what in the hell is going on?
Michael.
Where's Harry?
Uh, he was just here.
Uh, there's his phone.
(<em>gasps</em>)
(<em>indistinct radio chatter</em>)
Residents only.
You're gonna have to turn around or show some ID.
Sorry about that, Detective.
We've had some reports of break-ins.
Can never be too careful.
