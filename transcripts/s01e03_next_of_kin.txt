<p>I got it. I got it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>She seems a little cantankerous today.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>She's not always like that. I think, you know, big event like this... it's a little overwhelming for her.</p>
<p>Yeah, not just her, huh?</p>
<p>You look tired, Abby.</p>
<p>Oh my... shut up.</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>That's a very rude thing to say to a woman.</p>
<p>Didn't mean it...</p>
<p>That's rude.</p>
<p>I'm... I-I am worried about you.</p>
<p>Don't...</p>
<p>She's only gonna get worse, you know.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm familiar with what happens with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>I've done the reading.</p>
<p>Yeah, well.</p>
<p>Read this.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>It's a brochure for a memory care facility.</p>
<p>I put Mom's name on a list, and a room has opened up.</p>
<p>You put her on a list for a memory care facility without asking me?</p>
<p>Because I knew what you would say.</p>
<p>You don't know what I was gonna say.</p>
<p>&quot;I can handle this, Matt.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, I can handle it, Matt.</p>
<p>And I know you can and you have been, and I don't tell you enough, but you are a saint for doing it.</p>
<p>I'm not a saint. I'm a daughter.</p>

<p>It's not fair.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Stop it. No. It's because I made a choice that I want to take care of my mother. Okay?</p>
<p>And-and I've never complained about it, not once.</p>
<p>Saints don't complain. They suffer.</p>
<p>I'm not suffering.</p>
<p>This is my choice. It's important to me.</p>
<p>And, you know, I have the means.</p>

<p>You're so right.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, you got it.</p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>Look, I'll talk to you soon. Okay?</p>
<p>Tatiana. I'm Bobby.</p>
<p>We spoke on the phone.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Hi.</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles softly</em> )</p>
<p>Now I know why Chimney always calls you Gary Cooper.</p>
<p>I see you've had some visitors.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All day and last night, too.</p>
<p>Is that normal, or is Chimney just really popular?</p>
<p>Firefighters are a brotherhood.</p>
<p>Cops are the same way.</p>
<p>One of us goes down, we make sure the family's looked after.</p>
<p>And I'm the family?</p>
<p>I was hoping to convince you to come to the hospital to visit him.</p>
<p>I thought you said that he wasn't awake.</p>
<p>They're bringing him out of his coma now.</p>
<p>It'd be good if you were there.</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs</em> )</p>
<p>He asked me to marry him.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It's not right, you know.</p>
<p>Putting me in that kind of situation.</p>
<p>Either I say yes or I'm some kind of monster.</p>
<p>You don't have to say yes.</p>
<p>You just have to come hold his hand.</p>
<p>This is not about love, it's about decency.</p>
<p>That's my point.</p>
<p>Anything I do now that isn't being Florence Nightingale, it makes me look like some kind of jerk.</p>
<p>So, I hold his hand when he wakes up.</p>
<p>Then it's stay with him until he's out of the hospital.</p>
<p>And then it's you can't break up with him until he can walk or talk again, and that's assuming that he ever can.</p>
<p>And you want me to just play like I'm in love for how long?</p>
<p>A month? A year?</p>
<p>I am not a bad person.</p>
<p>I am just not in love with him.</p>
<p>Tatiana.</p>
<p>My friend is coming out of a medically induced coma.</p>
<p>I don't know if he'll ever fully wake up.</p>
<p>And if he does, I don't know if he's gonna be able to talk or see or hear or even remember who I am.</p>
<p>I am not asking you to love him or marry him, and I'm not judging you for your feelings. I'm not.</p>
<p>I'm just saying he loves you.</p>
<p>Misguided as he may be.</p>
<p>And the only two things I can think of to help him are to pray and to hope that if you're with him, he'll feel that love for you and it will give him a reason to fight his way back to us.</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs</em> ) I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I just can't.</p>
<p><strong>Abby</strong>: <em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>Um, she's had her midday pills, except I think I might have used next week's day-of-the-week box by accident.</p>
<p>Would you mind just checking on that?</p>
<p>We'll get it squared away.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So, should I ask?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Am I about to be out of a job?</p>

<p>( <em>Whispering</em> ): He can't do The Maneuver.</p>
