Never that sure about Henry.
Then he retired, and I finally was able to make up my mind.
I don't like the man.
Between you and me, I'm not sure Joan does either.
They weren't getting along?
You know, people used to retire at 65 back when life expectancy was 68.
Now, it's all early retirement and late life divorce.
I'm sorry, but I don't understand what any of this has to do with the break-in.
Someone broke into their home?
I assumed that was why you all were here.
Though honestly, you are a little late to the party.
That must've been three months ago.
Did the Wallaces tell you they'd had a break-in?
No. Their contractor did.
That window there was replaced.
The contractor hauled away some furniture and a rug, a bunch of Christmas decorations.
Said he painted and redid the floors too.
Redecorating the crime scene?
That's why we couldn't find anything.
Didn't see Joan or Henry for weeks.
They were out of town.
Do you remember when all of this happened?
January 11th.
Would you like the contractor's information?
Yes. Then I'd like to hug you.
(<em>Chuckles</em>)
I think it'd be best if Mr. Wallace stepped outside.
That's silly. Henry should stay.
My memory is terrible. Maybe he can help.
You can have this back. We made a copy.
Thanks.
I was wondering where that had got to.
<strong>Athena</strong>: When we were looking through it, we noticed that there didn't seem to be any entries about your trip, or the living room remodel.
(<em>Dramatic music</em>)
Did we remodel the living room?
No, that's right. We did.
I just don't remember why, though.
We just finished the house last year.
Why did we redo the living room?
Do you remember what happened on January 11th?
Maybe you were taking down Christmas decorations?
No, we always take those down right after New Year's.

We should've put all this stuff away last week.
What happens if we don't?
Does the world come screeching to a halt because the wreaths are up past MLK Day?
