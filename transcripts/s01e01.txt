ABBY: What's your emergency?
The first kind of emergency is the one we all have, every day.
You're looking at my emergency right now.
I'm 42 years old.
It's been a year since my boyfriend Tommy broke up with me.
I'm still not over it.
My mom's a big part of my emergency.
Alzheimer's disease, late-stage.
Mom, I'm going to work.
Veronica's in the kitchen.
Taking care of her pretty much takes up all my free time.
There's my number, right there, in case you need to call me for anything.
You don't have to tell me every time.
Sometimes you forget.
And then you forget you forget.
No, you're not.
Careful, careful. You got it. Good, good.
Ah.
I'm healed.
You look good today.
Mm.
Have a good day.
Drive carefully.
I will.
Ooh, you smell good.
Woo-hoo!
ABBY: Then there's the second kind of emergency, the kind you never want to have, the kind that comes without warning-- the car crash, the fire, the heart attack, the break-in.
That's the kind you call me about.
I'm the actual first responder.
WOMAN: My son.
He hit his head on the diving board, and he's not breathing.
ABBY: What's your address, ma'am?
Uh, 242 Beatrice Lane.
I'm in Beverly Hills. Please hurry!
Okay, paramedics are on the way.
Oh, my God.
He's turning blue!
I need you to perform CPR on him.
Do you remember what to do?
30 chest compressions followed by two breaths.
Okay.
30 and two.
Okay, Buck, start chest compressions.
Hen, start bagging him.
HEN: Got you, Captain.
Ma'am, come with me. I need to get my team in there.
Don't worry. He's gonna be all right.
He's gonna be all right. Please, just take a seat.
HEN: Get some of that water out.
BUCK: Coming around. Starting compressions.
CHIMNEY: Pulse ox is on. Pad's on.
I don't know.
A few minutes, maybe.
... seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17...
No.
...18, 19, 20. Go.
No rhythm.
: Come on. Come on.
ABBY: The crazy part is that as soon as help arrives...
... most people just hang up.
HEN: It's coming, it's coming, it's coming.
BUCK: Hey. Hey, man. That's it. Get it out.
BOBBY: Good job, kid.
Good job. Good job.
All right, kid, your mom is right here.
Whew.
You're gonna be okay.
Thank you.
: You'll be okay.
ABBY: I guess it's for the best that I usually don't know how it all ends.
The fireman is trying to talk her down.
This is so messed up.
ABBY: Are you friends with her?
Can you talk to her?
Well, we just get high together.
Everybody who's ever tried something like this and survived says the same thing: the second they step off that ledge, they regretted it.
I've been where you are.
I know how you feel.
Believe me.
There's hope.
Okay?
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.
I'll tell you all about it.
I can help you.
Please. Please.
No one can help me.
JUNKIE: No, no, no, no, no, no!
She jumped. She jumped.
ABBY: Is it weird that I feel more comfortable dealing with these kinds of emergencies than the one I have to deal with when I leave work and go home?
I don't know.
911. What's your emergency?
WOMAN: Yeah, I'm in the drive-through, and they only gave me six nuggets in my nine-piece, and this bitch manager won't give me my extra nugs.
Ma'am, it's against the law to call 911 with a non-emergency.
Eat your nuggets, get some perspective, and get the hell off my line.
* In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
... Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
My last confession...
: * Baby, you're a firework * Come on, show 'em what you're... * I'm so, so sorry. Um...
I'm new.
Mm.
But you're familiar with the basics of how this all works?
I am fully authorized to absolve any venial sins and assign penance.
What if I have to confess a mortal sin?
I'm kidding. Do you want to do this out on the pews?
Oh. Yes. Please.
My last confession was a week ago.
I was an alcoholic.
Did some drugs, too, near the end-- painkillers.
Lost a decade of my life, in and out of rehab.
Put on forced leave by the fire department.
But I got myself back together, and I've been back on the job for 18 months.
Your last confession was a week ago.
Weren't you already absolved?
It helps me to confess it all once a week, to remind myself how easy it is for me to end up on the wrong path.
But this week, I lost one. A woman.
A jumper.
PRIEST: It must be hard being a first responder.
The only way to survive the job is to find a way to cope with the ones you lose.
This is why you drank?
Like I said, we all find ways to cope.
Some drink, some do drugs, some gamble.
Some are sex addicts.
* We sit around * Our money's spent * Why can't you all get down?
* Drive ancient cars * Can't pay the rent * Why can't you all get down?
* Drink the water, it's a drought * * How are you this scared? This scared? * Groovyheels297?
This is cheating.
No, no, no.
You said if I got to you in five minutes, you would be all mine.
Is this why they call you Firehose?
No.
* Bad reputation * Bad reputation.
Someone punch you in the face?
What? Nah, it's a... it's a birthmark.
I dig it.
Hey, can I, uh...
... can I get your actual number?
You're cute.
And... you're very good at whatever it is we just did.
Let's not ruin everything by actually getting to know each other.
Damn.
We're living in a golden age.
POWELL : Merry Christmas.
Police, there's automatic rifle fire at Nakatomi!
I need backup assistance now!
McCLANE : Welcome to the party, pal!
CHIMNEY: I know exactly what that polite, distant smile means: she's bored.
One foot out the door.
This woman's so far out of my league, but she's just once-in-a-lifetime.
I can't let her go.
Lots of fish in the sea.
Not with the bait he's using.
Cruel but true. Mm.
I met her on this new dating site just for cops and firefighters, RomancingTheUniform. com.
She's an adrenaline junkie, so foreplay is me telling her stories about running into burning buildings and jumping into icy lakes and...
I'm sorry, wait. Remind me, when is the last time you ran into or jumped over anything?
I embellish a little.
Oh. Noted.
I'm telling you, the uniform is a major aphrodisiac.
Clearly.
Oh, damn.
Whew.
Hey!
I just...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wash your hands.
We don't know where they've been.
I was in the neighborhood.
I was just, uh, getting it washed.
They charge you extra for the full detail?
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
BOBBY: Listen, I like you. You're a good firefighter.
I know we got this thing-- you call me "Pops," and I give you a hard time for being a dumbass kid, we went to a Springsteen concert together.
But this is not a family. It's not a clubhouse.
So I'm writing you up.
Come on, Bobby.
See the fire, put out the fire. The rest is blah-blah.
No. The system and the rules are not arbitrary.
First infraction. Two more, you're out.
Wash your hands.
Thanks.
You know, you're not helping him by going easy on him.
He just needs a little direction.
I'll remind you of that after he gets you killed.
Anyone want to pass me a spoon, so I can serve myself some salad?
Oh, no.
No.
Let's do it.
The fourth floor.
I'll race you.
Ah, race yourself, Rambo.
I'm 50 years old. I'm taking the elevator.
Who's Rambo?
I don't hear anything.
Look, I'm telling you, I heard a baby crying.
Someone flushed a baby down the toilet.
Oh, I'm not high.
Okay, I-I'm pretty high, but it's a sativa.
You know? I-It makes you happy.
I-It doesn't make you hallucinate.
It could've been a cat, right?
Sometimes rats get stuck in the walls.
Shh.
Did you hear that?
Hey, do you know what, can you give me a stethoscope?
Okay.
Thanks.
Give me a pen. Give me a Sharpie.
Hey!
All right.
We need to open up this wall.
No, no. We're being punked.
It's a tape recorder or something. Right, Spicoli?
Mm-mm. Maybe he's right.
Maybe a mother gives birth on the toilet and flushes it.
Okay, first of all, that's awful.
Second, do you not know how a toilet pipe works?
There's this piece of serpentine pipe that takes the waste from the toilet to...
If this is a premature baby, its bones could bend and compress like sponges.
Okay? We need to go in there.
Stand back. I got this!
Whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!
Did you even stop to consider that you might hit a baby?
Yeah, I didn't think so. Go get the saw.
Okay. I'm, uh, I'm gonna...
Try to find some common sense while you're down there.
Fire and Rescue were first to arrive.
Theory is that some kid gave birth on a toilet and tried to flush the evidence, which got stuck in a pipe.
Theory? Has anyone located the mother to see if the theory's correct?
How many floors above where you were hearing the crying?
Uh, floor five and floor six.
All right, let's start on five.
Knock on every door. Don't be shy about going in if something doesn't seem right.
Don't we need a warrant or something?
Do I look like I'm asking you to make an arrest?
Let's do this.
LAPD!
LAPD. LAPD.
Hey. You have a teenage girl living here?
LAPD. LAPD.
All right.
All right, let's get it out.
Guys, that-that pipe services a quarter of the toilets above us; that's gonna be messy.
Oh, shoot.
Which means, even with the water off, if somebody flushes a toilet above us, it could drown the baby.
LAPD. Open up, sir.
Do you have a teenage girl living here with you?
I wish.
HEN: Do not flush your toilet! This is LAFD.
No one flush your toilets!
Do not flush your toilet!
This is LAFD!
Again, no one flush your toilet!
Hey, Hen. How's your day going?
Athena, peachy.
Do not flush your toilets!
LAPD. Open up. LAPD! LAPD!
This is LAFD. Please.
LAPD.
Nobody flush your toilets!
Okay? Please, don't.
Hey, sir. Sir!
Sir, we're looking for a girl... Uh, hey!
* Chimney.
Cut right down here on the bottom.
All right, Chimney, help me out, help me out.
Easy, easy, easy.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Up, hold it up.
Hold it up.
All right. All right, I see it. I see it.
Down. Let's pull it down here at the bottom.
Buck, I got it.
You got to cut right here.
Yeah.
Hold it still.
All right, it's off.
Get the head out, Bobby. Get the head out.
Yeah. You got to push from below.
All right.
Get the defibrillator.
I'm on it.
Yeah.
Just the lube, Buck.
All right. Here, Bobby.
Take it, take it.
All right, give it...
All right, work that in there, work that in there.
Got it up there. I got it. I got it.
All right, guys.
Wow, wow. Wow.
This is gonna be a scoop and run.
Hen, get the ambulance ready.
I'm ready here.
BOBBY: Okay, ready?
Come on.
It's moving.
It's coming. It's coming.
Oh, my God.
Stay on the shoulders.
I got it. I got it.
I got it.
Pull, pull. All right. Geez.
Okay, pull her out. Pull her out. Pull her out.
Pull her out.
I got it. I got it. I got it.
All right, she's not breathing. Starting CPR.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Maybe her airway's blocked.
Yeah.
I-I'll get the, uh...
Yep.
Get the pump.
Buck, come on!
I'm coming! I'm...
Yeah, she's not breathing. Bobby, it's-it's not working.
Come on.
Come on.
I got you.
I got you.
There we go. There we go.
Excellent.
There we go.
: Yeah.
All right. Okay, wrap her up.
Let's go.
Down to the lobby. Here we go.
All right, let's go, let's go.
Guess not.
Sorry, Cap. Come on, come on, come on.
Yo, give her to me. Yo, come on, I'm twice as fast.
Come on.
All right, you go.
Okay.
I got you.
I got you. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be great.
What happened?!
What you want?!
No.
MAN: Marika.
Your daughter just had a baby.
We have to get her to the hospital.
Go get ready! Get ready!
Come on, move it!
Come on, get ready!
Yeah, I got you.
Let's go.
Make way, folks. Make way.
Let's go, let's go!
Make way.
Hold up! Hold up! I got another one coming.
BUCK: Yo, is that the mother? No.
Screw her! Look what she did!
She's bleeding out!
She's a child!
He is refusing to take...
Okay, Bob.
All right, all right, come on.
Come on.
Marika.
Come on, guys. Hurry up.
Okay? Hurry up!
Yo, if this baby dies, it's on you.
MAN: Marika.
Hospital ETA, five minutes.
Hang in.
Gonna go over here.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
Whoa. All right.
O2 sat 59.
I can't get a pulse.
MARIKA: I'm so sorry.
Is she gonna die?
Come here. Give me your hand.
It's all right. It's okay.
Here we go.
All right.
See? Told you we'd make it, didn't I?
Come on. Oh, here we go.
You ready Oh. Hey.
They're gonna take care of you now, okay?
You're gonna be okay now, aren't you?
Get the baby to the NICU.
Get the mother hooked up in room four.
All right.
I'm gonna see you in there. All right, come on, Bobby.
Let's go.
Hey, hey, hold on. Where you going?
That baby is alive because of us.
Don't-don't we have some kind of obligation?
I'll give them a call; we'll be lucky if they tell us if she's okay.
There's nothing more we can do.
We did our jobs very well today, so far.
Just be proud of that. Now it's their turn.
ATHENA: Hey!
You do not get to choose who lives and who dies.
'Cause I was under the impression that kind of was my job.
That mother was no less of a child than her baby.
You're gonna get someone killed.
Well, maybe, but not today.
Yeah, you keep making jokes.
I promise you, the next time you screw up, it'll be your last.
What?
Get in the truck.
Good morning, everyone.
You want a waffle?
ATHENA: Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No whispering at the table.
You got something to say, just speak up.
Would it be okay if only one of you guys came to family day at school tomorrow?
MAY: Because you can't stand being in the same room together, anyway.
It makes everyone uncomfortable.
Are you getting a divorce?
Of course not, sweetheart.
You're lying.
Hey, watch your mouth.
ATHENA: Baby.
Married people have problems all the time.
But you two never fight or argue unless it's something really bad.
I want to tell them.
Michael.
My therapist said tell them when they're ready.
Well-well, I'm saying that I'm not ready.
Come here. Come here, baby.
Michael.
Kids, your dad has been struggling with something his entire life.
But...
with the courage that I get from being your dad, the way that you love me and see me...
Please.
... I feel strong enough to be honest about it.
I'm gay.
So you are getting a divorce.
No, no, sweetheart. We're not even talking about that.
May, baby, y-your dad just told me a couple of weeks ago.
The grandmas are gonna whisper about us in church now.
And the kids at school are gonna find out, and maybe beat Harry and I up about it.
MICHAEL: No. No.
Your mother and I will not let that happen. Do you understand?
Can't you just keep it a secret?
I'm fine with whatever.
I just don't want anybody else to know.
May, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Look...
Don't look at me like that.
I have nothing to be ashamed of.
You know, I get that you feel good about coming out.
Good for you.
Please.
But don't think you can hide behind that pride when it comes to me.
You lied to me.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Get-- Don't you touch me!
Don't you touch me! How could you do this to me?!
Okay.
You should have told me from the beginning!
I didn't have to tell you. You already knew.
But you just went along to get along.
Oh, I'm sorry if I thought that the fact that my husband didn't pay other women any mind meant he was true to me!
Look, you even said it yourself.
I don't lay you like other men.
You humiliated me just so you wouldn't humiliate yourself.
And if you don't see that, you're the one that's in denial.
Yes.
Hey, you know, denial worked just fine when you were a 37-year-old single woman whose biological clock was running out.
You were perfectly happy to deny what you could clearly see about me.
And I said that I wanted those kids, too.
Don't you forget that!
What is that?
You've had it, like, a million times, Mom.
Don't think I like it.
Well...
Why don't you save it for when your dad gets back from work, hmm?
He's not coming home, is he?
No.
Oh.
Yeah.
Mm, yeah.
For, like, ten years.
Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry.
Don't be sorry.
You're just having a tough day today.
Hmm.
And Veronica's here.
Veronica, you're half an hour late.
I have to get to work. You can't keep doing this, or I'm gonna have to hire somebody else.
Whatever.
I work for SSI. I can't be fired, just moved off to someone else.
Wow, I really love that go-getter attitude, V.
I love you, Mom.
Love you, darling.
You take care of yourself today, okay?
Bye, Mom.
My snake.
L. A. fire!
All right, guys, check all these rooms.
Anybody here?
L. A. fire!
Wow.
Oh, my God.
Bobby, I can't do snakes. They scare the crap out of me.
That scene from Conan the Barbarian with the giant snake, it traumatized me for life.
I-I can't.
Conan the Barbarian. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
1982. Geez.
Dude, as far as I'm concerned, the world began the day I was born.
BOBBY: Guys, in here. Back here, guys, now.
HEN: Oh, my God.
We got to help her get some air, guys.
Oh, my...
Oh, my God. Oh, I... This is not good.
HEN: Bobby, it's no use. That thing is, like, ten feet long.
Its constriction strength is, like, 50 pounds per square inch.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna start calling you "Snake-ipedia." Stop it.
All I'm saying is that you'd stand a better chance of tearing down a cement wall with your bare hands.
Why don't I just punch it in its face?
You can't punch it in the face, Buck. It's a snake.
It's not some guy at an El Torito happy hour.
HEN: Look, I have Dilaudid.
We can inject the snake. It'll pass right out.
BOBBY: How much time is that gonna take?
Minutes. And minutes we don't have.
I think we're gonna have to put it down.
Kill it. No! No, um, no!
Kill it. Just kill it.
It's a snake.
It's doing what nature intended for it to do.
Nobody told this fool to bring a snake into her house!
Yeah, well, I'll make a donation to PETA for you.
Crap. It's getting really tight.
BUCK: Okay, stand back.
We don't have time for this!
Buck!
No!
Okay.
Wow. Why is that always the first option for you white boy, macho tough guys?
Guys, I am totally gonna take credit for this with Tatiana.
It's gonna get me laid for a week. Thank you.
Oh, Spartacus.
Yeah, well, it was him or you, and, uh, when faced with a situation like that, I always choose to save the more attractive one.
Is that right?
Oh, yeah, that's right.
HEN: Okay.
Hard pass. I'm gonna skip the part where the two idiots flirt.
You can expect a visit from animal control.
Hey, Buck.
Oh.
Ah.
Really?
Um...
I'm a collector. I'm not a hoarder.
I think you should probably leave.
Um, did you follow me here?
The truck has a GPS beacon, moron.
Ugh.
No. W...
Just call me later if you're free.
I'll be at home. Alone.
You're fired.
What? Wait. That's not fair. You said I got three strikes.
Doesn't matter. You've made this choice yourself, and you rubbed it in my face.
The same exact infraction two days after I wrote you up.
It's not 1950 anymore, Buck. We work with women side by side.
When you swing your dick around, you disrespect them.
Wait, Bobby! Bobby, I-I think I may be a sex addict.
Self-diagnosed.
You think this is a joke?
No.
I'm not joking.
How much does your kit weigh when you're fully geared up?
Uh, I don't, I don't know.
60 pounds, give or take.
Right. 60 pounds.
So when you choose this life, you find a way to leave everything behind you, except that 60 pounds.
I don't care if you got problems with your wife, with money, with alcohol, with keeping it in your pants.
All that stuff weighs you down, it slows you down, and if we lose a couple seconds, people die.
So, you want to disrespect yourself, that's fine with me.
You want to disrespect these women that you chase around, that's on them, but you are done disrespecting our firehouse and this fire department.
No, Bobby. Bobby! I need this job!
Look, I love this job.
Don't do this to me.
I don't have anything else.
I'm sorry, kid. I said you're done.
I guess you heard?
Yeah.
For what it's worth, everyone thinks it sucks.
It's my own fault.
Yeah.
Everyone thinks that, too.
I'll be honest.
When Bobby first brought you on board, I told him he should just get a Dalmatian instead.
But I'm legit sorry to see you go.
You got some skills.
Just not a lot of discipline.
Look, hey, um, I don't suppose you could maybe talk to him for me?
DISPATCHER : Ladder, medic. 10-36 auto emergency.
Hey, tough break, kid.
DISPATCHER: Ladder, medic. 10-36 auto emergency.
Hen, let's roll.
Okay, Lily, my name is Abby. I'm gonna try to help you.
I don't know.
We just moved here.
Do you know what street you live on?
Um, Lambert.
Okay, Lambert.
It's a brown house!
Lily?
Shoot.
Residential break-in.
Caller is a nine-year-old female, home alone.
No GPS on her phone, no street address.
She did have a street name-- Lambert.
There are three Lamberts in the greater L. A. area: Boyle Heights, Santa Fe Springs and Winnetka.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can hear you.
They got in.
I'm up in my room.
Okay. That's okay. What is the name of your city?
W-Winnetka.
Okay. We got to start pinging cell towers.
Pinging towers in the Valley.
ABBY: Now, listen.
I need you to stay on the phone. Don't hang up.
We're gonna try to find you.
I've got multiple daytime break-ins in this area over the last couple of months.
Lily, is there anything near you that looks like it would have your address on it?
Mail or anything like that?
Can you look outside?
LILY: I can't see any numbers.
TERRY: Towers narrow it to a quarter mile.
I know you said your house is brown. Is there anything else ABBY: All available units, residential break-in on Lambert Road, Winnetka, somewhere between the 100 and 1500 blocks of Chanel and Hadley.
Two-story single family dwelling.
Brown house, white trim, garage door is white. Child alone in the home.
Caller says there's a pink girl's five-speed bike sitting on the front porch.
You got to be kidding me.
I'm in Steven Spielberg land.
LILY: I'm here.
What's your mother's name?
Emma.
Emma Coughlin.
Okay, we got 14 Emma Coughlins.
None of them in Winnetka.
ABBY: Do you know her phone number?
Uh, it's in the phone.
Here's what I want you to do.
Do not hang up the phone. Look at the menu in the phone, and read me what the number says.
I think so.
Stay on the line. I'm gonna call your mom now.
Okay.
LILY: It's ringing in her room.
Sometimes she forgets it on the charger.
ABBY: Officer, maybe if you put on your siren, I could determine where you are in relation to her.
I could guide you to her.
I don't think we want these guys knowing that the cops are here.
This area's had a spate of daytime break-ins recently, and one homicide.
We need to find this girl.
Maybe we still can.
HEN: Hey. What's up, Thena?
ATHENA : I need a favor.
Think you can loan me a fire truck?
Um, it's kind of in use at the moment. Why?
I'll have something for you in less than five.
She sent you, huh?
I was available.
All right. No heroics.
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
I don't know what that means.
Nobody thought you would.
Lily?
: Abby, I'm downstairs.
ABBY: What are you doing downstairs?
Petey! Petey!
Petey! There's a kid in the house who's got a phone.
PETEY: That's twice you said my name.
Now we got to find it.
PETEY : I'll get this one's phone.
Just need the phone.
(siren wailing, horn honking over phone) DEAN: It's the cops!
We've got it.
That's it.
You just passed her, cowboy.
Relax. It's just a fire truck.
Come on, kid. I just want the phone.
BUCK: Oh, yeah, I see the pink bike.
Yeah.
You, uh, you can't go in there right now.
Is there a fire?
No, no.
No, ma'am, no fire. Just come.
Just get behind the truck, okay? Come on.
PETEY: Come out, kid. We just want the phone.
DEAN: Petey!
I got her!
Officer, how close are you?
Close.
Abby!
Petey! Petey, Petey!
Petey! Petey!
Peter! Petey! Petey!
Peter! Petey!
This is 911 operator Abby Clark.
I need to explain something to you about this emergency.
This emergency is yours. I have dispatched the police to your exact location.
I know exactly what road they're gonna go down, I know what door they're gonna walk into, and I am prepared to help you escape.
Because I don't care about you at all, but I care about that little girl.
So you have exactly two seconds to make a decision here.
You can either walk away from her and walk away from the police, or you can sit there and wait for whatever hellfire is about to be brought down on your head.

Back door.
What about the bike, man?
Forget the bike.
LILY: Let me out! Please!
PETEY: Yeah, I see it.
Because I have a grid of the entire neighborhood in front of me.
You're gonna go over the wall.
Better not be any cops on the other side.

Just needed you out of the house.
Get on the ground!

No, you just think you are.
ABBY: I heard a gunshot. Is Where is she?
BUCK: The little girl? No, she's good.
She's back with her mom, and you should be here.
Oh, my God.
I feel like I am.
Wow. Um...
Okay, well, I can't thank you enough.
I-I... I'm so grateful.
You saved that little girl, and...
No, you did.
You kept her in the game long enough for us to find her.
You're the real hero here.
Well, I appreciate you saying that.
Thank you.
I know what this looks like.
Looks like you took the engine out in your street clothes.
I didn't really have time to change.
Athena Grant called me, wanted to tell me what an asset you are.
Told her she was half right.
("Under Pressure" by Queen playing) MICHAEL : Athena.
Uh, kids get home from school okay?
Yeah, yeah.
They're inside doing their homework.
Everything okay?
Yeah. Just checking in.
You giving me another chance?
You've used all your chances; so have I.
Because somehow I have failed to communicate to you how lucky we are to do what we do.
* Pressure...
You're wrong, Bobby.
I absolutely do get what a privilege it is to serve here.
And you know what? You were right to fire me.
I was a punk.
Uh, I still am one.
But I'm a punk who understands what he lost.
Just needed you to know that.
I hope you mean that.
So are we talking again now?
No.
MICHAEL: You want us to wait for you for dinner?
* Tomorrow gets me higher...
Yeah. Yeah.
Go get dressed.

To run towards danger, rather than run away from it.
And for those of us that choose this life, there's no place we'd rather be.
