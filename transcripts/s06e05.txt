(crickets chirping) (loud clatter) (gasps) (loud clatter) (line ringing) You're on a landline, so I've got your address.
Help is on the way. Can you tell me your name?
My name is Sharlo Darzi.
Oh, my God, I think they're downstairs.
Okay, Sharlo, help is on the way.
I just need some information. Do you live alone?
(whispering): With my husband, but he's out of town all week.
I have to get out of here.
<i> JOSH:</i> <i> You should stay</i> <i> where you are.</i> Officers are headed your way now, Sharlo.
Is there someplace you can hide until they arrive?
<i> Are you still there?</i> (whispering): I'm not waiting. <i> Sharlo...</i> No. I have to get out.
Sharlo, it's better if you stay put.
No. What if they find me?
<i> I don't have a way</i> <i> of defending myself.</i> <i> I'm going to the neighbor's</i> <i> house.</i> Okay, can you give me your gate code?
I'll relay it to the officers.
Oh, no, I don't have the gate clicker.
<i> It's in my car.</i> <i> I have to go through</i> <i> the kitchen.</i> Sharlo, I need you to stay inside the house until the police arrive.
<i> And can you give me</i> <i> the gate code</i> <i> so they can make entry?</i> <i> SHARLO:</i> <i> The gate code is 9-2-7-3-5-3.</i> <i> And I'm not waiting for them.</i> <i> JOSH:</i> <i> Police are seconds away.</i> I am not staying in here.
(thud, door creaks) Oh, God.
Sharlo, what's happening?
(whimpering) Are they in the house?
(screaming) (Sharlo cries out) (line goes dead) (gasps) Sh-Sharlo?
Ma'am, ma'am, are... Can you hear me?
(siren wailing) <i> ATHENA:</i> <i> Dispatch, this is 727-L-30,</i> <i> approaching the residence now.</i> (indistinct police radio chatter) (sirens approaching) We responded to a home invasion in progress.
Found the homeowner unconscious.
And the invaders?
ATHENA: House is clear.
No signs of forced entry?
ATHENA: Uh, just some spilled food in the kitchen.
Dispatch says that she called from upstairs.
Spotted the intruder in the kitchen and ran.
She took one hell of a tumble.
She's breathing but unresponsive.
Pulse is elevated.
I mean, something must have really scared her, right?
You-you sure there's no one else here?
I'm positive, Detective Buckley.
(Sharlo groaning) We have to get out. We have to...
(loud crack) (Sharlo yells, others groan) That was her pelvis.
Ma'am, I need you to stay still.
A pelvic injury can lead to internal hemorrhaging.
I'll give you something for the pain, okay?
Start a line. Four milligrams of morphine.
I got the splint sheet.
(groaning) Ma'am, you told 911 that you saw someone in the kitchen.
Who did you see?
(pained cry) It wasn't a man. It was...
a monster.
Ma'am, we didn't find anyone in the house.
It was in the kitchen.
Breadcrumbs.
(chittering) This is Buckley.
I've apprehended the suspect.
(chuckles) Oh!
Careful, Buckley.
You could break a hip.
(exhales sharply) I told my husband to get rid of the dog door.
We don't even have a dog anymore.
BOBBY: Don't worry, ma'am, no more home invasions.
I've got my top man on the case.
(whirring) (raccoon chittering) And stay out.
<i> MADDIE:</i> <i> When was the last time we had</i> an entire meal at this table uninterrupted?
I don't think it's ever happened.
So what should we do now?
I think I'm gonna have another cup of coffee.
Oh, uh, Magda, you don't have to do this.
You're here for Jee, not us.
I can do both. (chuckles) So, uh, where are you two off to today?
The park.
A little fresh air, some sunlight.
It kills potentially harmful bacteria.
I have your phone numbers. I've turned on location sharing.
I have power.
I packed all of Jee-yun's favorite snacks and toys.
It'll be fine. Hmm?
Say bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Oh, bye-bye, baby. Love you.
Bye, Mommy.
Bye, Jee, I love you.
You both have a great day at work. Hmm?
You, too.
This is weird.
This is totally weird.
We just let a woman we've known for less than a week walk off with our daughter.
We did extensive background checks.
We called 11 of her references. Should we have done 12?
We should have done 12.
She can turn off location sharing.
I sewed a GPS tracker into her stuffed animal.
(both laugh) So we're gonna be fine?
Yeah.
Okay.
Ha!
All right, let's clean up and go to work.
Okay.
(phones chime) Oh, it's from Magda.
"Leave the dishes. I'll take care of them." (phones chime) "I have a system." How did she know?
<i> NOAH:</i> <i> So how's the new nanny?</i> It's good, I think.
I'm still getting used to a stranger being in my home, and she prefers the term "household manager." Who does?
Maddie and Chimney's new nanny.
Uh...
Household manager.
You hired someone to manage your household?
Well, now that Chimney and I are living together, we're saving on rent, so we have enough to hire some help.
Fire her. Fire her now.
Why are we already firing this person?
Do you know her?
Don't need to.
It's a stranger in your home.
All in your business. Recipe for disaster.
It's gonna be fine, I think.
I'm sensing there's a story here.
The story is called <i> Downton Abbey.</i> The help is always watching, overstepping and talking smack. You never seen it?
No. Now I kind of want to.
Mm-hmm.
(door shuts) <i> ATHENA: Are we hanging out</i> <i> or moving back?</i> Is the second one an option?
(chuckles) I just need a quiet place to study.
What about your apartment?
It's been invaded.
One of my roommates has this new frat-boy boy toy.
I can't escape him. He's always there.
Doesn't he have classes of his own?
I'm starting to doubt that.
(sniffles) Oh...
Oh.
Are you okay?
(door opens, shuts) Your apartment is not the only place that's being invaded.
Oh.
Hey, May.
Hey.
Oh, my God, you got a dog? When?
Well, he's sort of a rescue.
You always said we couldn't get a dog.
What?
Mom's allergies.
(sneezes) You said this was a cold.
Oh, you seemed so attached...
Oh.
I thought maybe it wouldn't be that bed.
He does seem really sweet, Mom.
BOBBY: Oh, he's a great dog.
I don't suppose they allow pets at your place?
(sneezes) Oh.
(dog yawns) BOBBY: Okay.
I guess Hoover's gonna need a new home.
What's your address?
<i> 719 Alexander Street.</i> Is there more than one suspect in the house?
<i> Definitely more than one.</i> Do they know you're in the house?
<i> I don't think so. I came home</i> <i> to grab a few things.</i> <i> I came upstairs,</i> <i> and I heard them talking.</i> Police are on their way.
Are you in a safe location right now?
<i> No. I'm afraid to go</i> <i> back downstairs.</i> <i> They may see me.</i> Is there another room upstairs where you can hide?
<i> Maybe the guest room.</i> <i> INTRUDER: Somebody's home!</i> <i> Somebody's home!</i> <i> CALLER:</i> <i> Oh, God!</i> <i> INTRUDER: He's running.</i> <i> Don't let him get away.</i> <i> (gunshot)</i> <i> (man cries out)</i> <i> INTRUDER: I got him!</i> Hello, sir are you there? <i> (gunshots)</i> Sir?

<i> (gunshots)</i> SUE: He's alive.
The paramedics dropped him off at the ER, and he's on his way into surgery now.
When I heard those gunshots...
The thing that makes us good at our jobs is the ability to listen closely and then picture what's happening on the other end of the line.
Sometimes those pictures are the stuff of nightmares.
By any chance, did they catch the guys that shot him?
No. Suspects were long gone by the time the police and paramedics arrived.
A home invasion in the middle of the day.
Yeah, robberies have definitely been on the rise.
And suspects are just getting a little more brazen.
Let's hope they find them before they strike again.
(sirens approaching) Rick.
Thanks.
What happened?
Hey. I heard you responded to a home invasion call here last night.
I wanted you to walk me through it.
ATHENA: Sharlo Darzi called in thinking she had an intruder.
Turned out just to be a raccoon.
So, who's our new victim?
Samir Darzi. The husband.
I thought he was out of town.
Flew back this morning when he found out about his wife.
He came home to pick some things out for her, discovered a robbery in progress, called 911.
They shot him while he was on the phone with the dispatcher. Three shots.
One in the shoulder, two in the back.
The raccoon definitely didn't do this.
Two home invasion calls from the same address less than 12 hours apart.
What are the odds?
Not ones I like.
Plan for today. I'll take Denny to school, but I have some meetings this afternoon, so Clive will pick him up after school and take him to practice.
I like when you poach the eggs.
Don't get pretentious.
Tony is gonna stop by midday to bring you some lunch, and I'll pick up Denny and dinner after work.
We should be home around 7:00.
Oh. What do I do all day?
Study.
So you could ace your practical exam with Doctor... What's-Her-Face.
Oh. Simmons.
Exactly.
See? We've got it all covered.
All you have to do is study.
(knock at door) Ooh, and get the door.
Denny, help me clear the table, please, now.
Yeah.
Cap.
Hey, Hen.
I'm sorry to just show up.
But I need a favor.
Let me guess.
Probably more than a favor.
Hoover, the infamous rescue dog?
To whom my wife is apparently highly allergic.
Bobby...
I know it's a lot to ask, but I figure you got plenty of space, you got a nice, big backyard...
And a wife who has sworn off pets since Paisley died.
Hoover is exceptional.
Uh, d-don't look at me like that.
You, either.
Oh, my God, is that a dog?
Yes, it is.
(Hoover barks) You are gonna owe me big-time.
Here.
Take it.
(toy squeaks) Yeah, he loves that thing.

My key doesn't work.

Of course you did.
Wait, where did you get a key?
Oh, Mom thought you could use some help around the house.

You break one toilet...
And three dishwashers.

He lent me his spray foam truck.
You borrowed a truck of foam?
Good stuff.
R-seven per inch.
And how many inches?
In California, it is recommended that your attic should have an R Value between 30 and 60.
So I'm thinking five inches.
(scoffs) You almost sound like you know what you're doing.
This stuff will save you thousands in heating and cooling costs.
And it'll block out all the traffic noise outside.
Like soundproofing. Come on, it's your first place.

Have you tried calling him?
I've been calling him since before I called you.
He's not answering.
(line ringing) I'm not hearing any ringing.
Uh, he said he would soundproof the house.
Yeah, well, it looks like he insulated it pretty good, too.
I'm not getting any kind of heat signature.

Old-fashioned pick and poke.

Guys, I want you to start poking inspection holes.
I want to find the edges of that plywood floor up there.

No, it wouldn't be enough.
We need something stronger.
Well, you know what? This is a DIY family, so let's DIY it.

BOBBY: Gurney coming in. Gurney coming in.
Ma'am, I need you to stay outside.
It's not safe in here.
On three. One, two, three.
Yeah.
Pull him up on three. One, two, three!
Checking airway.
Lungs are clear, but breathing is shallow.
All right, let's get him out of here! Let's move!
Sats at 92, starting him on high-flow O2.
Pulse is thready.
Beginning sternum rub.
Vincent, can you hear us?
No response.
Breathing is shallow.
Vincent, I'm gonna give you some rescue breaths here.
Start breathing with this. Come on, buddy.
Why isn't he waking up?
Come on, Vincent!
Come on, buddy.
Vincent, come back to us, buddy.

That's it, that's it!
There you go.
Vincent, thank God.

You almost died.
I can't believe that you were up there.
I just wanted to prove I could do it. Help you.

You know what would be helpful? To not almost die on me.
Never do that again.
Okay. Is the house okay?
We'll talk about it later.
(siren wailing) Hey there.
You ready for your big day tomorrow?
I think so. You want to quiz me?
Oh.
Mm-hmm.
What happened to the only thing I should be focused on is studying?
Well, you've been studying nonstop, and now it's time to let it go and trust that you've done your best.
And reward yourself for all your hard work.
What kind of reward did you have in mind?
(both laugh) I can't.
What?
Not with him watching.
(whining) Are you serious?
It's making me uncomfortable.
(sighs) Okay. Okay.
I'll just let him out.
Come here, boy. Yeah, that's a good boy.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, there you go.
Enjoy yourself.
Now...
(chuckles) ... where were we?
(Hoover whining) Oh, now he sounds sad.
Maybe he'll go down the hall to Denny's room.
(scratching at door) (sighs) (Hoover whining) Fine. Fine.
Fine, fine.
Fine. It's just fine.
Okay, you can come in, just...
Hey, Hoover, no, that's...
You are such a mood killer.
(knock on door) Hey, you apprehend our armed robbers yet?
No. But I think our home invasion is not an isolated case.
I found ten other burglaries in the last month with a similar M. O.
Pricey neighborhoods hit at all different times of the day, but in each case, the residents were never home.
Until Samir Darzi came home and got shot.
Mm.
That house have security cameras?
Oh, yeah.
Two guys, average height, average build, wearing ski masks and generic track suits.
They walk up with rolling duffel bags, they go inside, and they roll back out with all the jewelry and luxury items they can fit in the bags.
In and out in less than 20.
And they didn't set off any alarms or break a single door or window.
Yeah, I mean, they must have cased the place in advance, but what I can't figure out is how they pick their targets.
The victims don't have anything in common, except for being rich.
ATHENA: And the fact that they were guaranteed never to be home.
Wait. How?
Here.
"A homeowner interview was conducted "at El Dorado Union Hospital as Mr. Drake was recovering from heart surgery following a coronary incident." Okay, so this victim had a heart attack.
His house was broken into that night.
This one.
It says that the homeowner was injured in a kitchen fire.
She was still also in the hospital when her house was hit.
And there's another one.
"Victim is still recovering from a fractured shoulder after an unrelated slip and fall in the shower." Maybe not that unrelated.
Okay, so you have an accident or a medical emergency, you're in the hospital.
It's a great time for someone to come and rob you blind.
It still doesn't explain how they were able to get in and out the way they did.
I mean, they wouldn't have had time to case the place.
Unless someone had already done it for them.
Think about it. You're at home.
You start having chest pains, or you set your kitchen on fire. What do you do?
You call for help.
And "help" is gonna ask a lot of questions.
Paramedics can reset the alarm, ma'am. What is the alarm code?
Sir, the fire department is on the way.
You said you live alone?
Are there any dogs at your residence?
That's what all the victims had in common.
They all dialed 911.
(elevator bell chimes) So every robbery victim called 911?
Seems like the thieves used the hospital visits as an open invitation.
We need to look at everyone who was aware of the emergencies at these addresses, see if there's any overlap.
And you think a first responder might be involved in this?
Afraid so.
All right, let me check the list.
Um, Linda took this call. Linda Bates.
The 133 responded.
This one dispatcher was Josh Russo.
He sent the 142 to that scene.
Josh also took the raccoon call, but that time, he sent the 118.
This one in Brentwood, dispatcher was Rashida Marvel.
Firehouse was the 126.
Marlene took this other call, Jamal dispatched that one.
Henry, Moira. This is me.
I don't see anything in common here.
Yeah, other than residents from affluent zip codes.
It was worth a shot.
Yep. Well, thank you, Maddie.
Oh, wait.
What? You found something?
Yeah.
Every time someone pulls up a call record, the system makes a note of it-- who did it and when.
All of these calls were accessed multiple times by the same person.
Great. So who's our common denominator?
Uh...
Me.
Whoa, Magda, what is going on here?
Cleaning. I want everything to be pristine.
It's getting there.
Oh, don't worry, I have a system.
I'll put everything back in its place before... (gasps) You're wearing shoes.
Yeah, I sometimes do that, for the walking.
Did you know that shoes are 66,000 times dirtier than toilets?
I do now.
Uh, I'll take 'em off.
Just let me put this somewhere...
Mm...
All... right.
(Magda chuckles) (Magda sighs) So, uh, where's Maddie and Jee-Yun?
Oh, Maddie put Jee-Yun to bed an hour ago.
Then she went in the bathroom. She's been in there a while.
Probably plotting her escape.
What?
I should go make sure she's okay.
All right.
MADDIE: Who is it?
It's me.
Please let me in.
Come in.
Quick, close the door.
What is going on out there?
And what are you doing in the bathtub?
I needed a place to hide.
Jee's asleep, and Magda launched a full-on cleaning offensive.
Yeah, I had to cross enemy lines just to get in here.
I mean, I told her not to, but she insisted.
(grunts) Thank you.
Look at us. We're literally tiptoeing around our own house.
How was your day otherwise?
Oh, great.
I am a suspect in a string of burglaries.
The police think someone at the call center is using our log-in information to pick out potential victims.
Okay, but not you.
But whoever it is used my I. D. to access the files.
Athena said it won't take long to clear me because I wasn't even at the call center when half the log-ins happened.
Wow.
You think someone stole your password?
I guess so.
But I don't know how.
It's weird. It's not like you're logging in from a coffee shop or something.
No, but someone took my password anyway.
(indistinct chatter) (elevator bell chimes) Hi.
Hey. Anything you want to tell me?
(indistinct conversation) Hey. I thought you were off today.
Maddie, are you all right?
I don't know.
They called me in. Sue wants to see me.
Why?
I think I'm getting fired.
Fired? What?
Yeah, you know about the burglaries.
Right? All the victims called 911, and they think that I'm the connection.
But they didn't call you, did they?
No, but my log-in was used to access those recordings, and nobody else had that information.
Maddie, they can't fire you.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Doesn't matter.
My name is on all the call records.
But if that's all they have...
It's enough.
Even if they can't prove that I helped the thieves, because I didn't, I can't prove that I wasn't negligent with my password.
They can't arrest me, but I can lose my job anyway.
No. That's not fair.
Honestly, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I mean, I love this place.
Helping people, saving lives.
You know what I mean?
That feeling you get when you know that you're doing the right thing?
Yeah.
It's all gonna go away because of some stupid lost password.
You didn't lose your password, Maddie.
I took it.
That day I asked you about the active logs, you showed me how to access them.
Put in your I. D. number, and...
<i> NOAH:</i> <i> I watched you log in.</i> I almost forgot about that.
I used the calls to find out when a house would be empty, and I passed along the information.
I promise you, Maddie, no one was supposed to get hurt.
The houses were supposed to be empty.
I-I was always careful.
You weren't careful. You were lucky.
A man got shot. He could've died.
I know.
And I'm really sorry.
I just didn't know what else to do.
Why would you do this?
My stepdad-- he got into some money trouble.
He didn't want my mom and I to know, so he borrowed from the wrong people.
When he couldn't repay them, they hurt him.
He said they were gonna hurt my mom, too.
They knew I worked here.
So you were trying to repay his debt.
I didn't know what else to do.
I was too scared to tell anyone.
(sighs) I wish you would've told me.
We could've helped you.
Can you help me now?
Please, Maddie.
I'm sorry.
It's too late.
(sighs) You tricked me.
MADDIE: You lied to us.
To me.
What do I do?
Tell them everything.
If they can find these guys...
I know where they are.
What do you mean?
I told them about your investigation.
I thought that would make them stop.
They wanted one more job.
You gave them another house to hit?

How'd I do?
BOBBY: There you go.
And how would our guest of honor like her burger cooked?
Doesn't even matter, just as long you're the one flipping 'em, Cap. (laughs) Seriously, you and Athena didn't have to do all this.
Hey, we want to celebrate you.
Passing this exam is a big deal. Don't downplay it.
(chuckles) Because Lord knows I won't.
I will be bragging about this for a while.
(laughs) My rock star paramedic wife is about to be a doctor, y'all.
(laughter) She's my hype woman.
And proud of it.
But not as proud as I am of you.
HEN: Mm.
I'm still pretty shocked that I survived it, honestly.
It was looking pretty bleak for a minute.
Survived it? You killed it.
And for the record, we had no doubt.
Paging Dr. Wilson.
Oh.
(laughs) I'll toast to that.
To Hen, and her beginning this new journey on a high note.
Congratulations, but we're still gonna miss you.
To Hen.
GROUP: To Hen!
BOBBY: To Henrietta Wilson.
(chuckles) Hey, you guys think this is gonna be the last time we...
you know, we're all together like this?
(laughter) No.
We live like 20 minutes from each of you.
This will not be the last time that we're together.
I certainly hope not, although you are gonna be pretty busy.
So we won't hold it against you when you ghost us.
(Bobby laughs) <i> CHIMNEY:</i> <i> You're not gonna survive</i> if you take this on all by yourself, Hen.
(light laughter) ♪ ♪ (cheering) ♪ ♪ I'm really gonna miss you guys.
We're gonna miss you, too.
♪ ♪ Um, hey, speaking of-of missing people, uh, I-I don't see Hoover.
Yeah. Where is he?
Hoover has found his forever home.
In somebody else's home.
(laughter) Athena found Hoover the perfect spot.
It's a quiet neighborhood, house with a big yard.
Older couple, no kids.
Yeah, husband travels a lot, the wife hates being alone, so I asked her if she wanted a new watchdog.
Mm, mm-hmm.
Yes!
(laughter) Right?
Cheers to that.
Cheers to that!
SAMIR: They want me to fly to Denver on Monday.
(sighs) Honey, are you listening to me?
Hmm?
Who's a good boy?
Yes.
Huh.
Maddie!
Hey.
How was the party?
Bittersweet. Everybody missed you.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I just...
Didn't feel like celebrating.
I get it.
So you sent Magda home early?
I sent Magda home permanently.
Look, this is our house.
We deserve to be able to relax, be ourselves and not feel bad about it.
You think we should find someone else?
I think I'm gonna need a minute before I'm ready to start trusting new people again.
All right, I guess it's back to the family and friends plan for child care, but okay.
Daddy, picnic.
Hey! Baby Jee!
Is that what the blanket's for?
Yeah. She was sad that she didn't get to have her park picnic because it's a breeding ground for infection.
Ah, so we're gonna eat on the floor tonight?
Should be clean enough.
(laughing) What is so funny?
You re-homed the nanny.
Well, somebody had to.
(laughing) I've been calling contractors all over town, and nobody has the time to take a job this small.
Uh, hang on, Mom.
Uh, hi.
We thought maybe you could use a hand with some repairs.
Yeah, we heard somebody really destroyed your house.
Uh, Mom, I got to go.
All right.
(alarm blaring) (mechanical whirring) We're on the third floor of the lab sciences building.
<i> DISPATCHER:</i> <i> Is the building on fire?</i> CALLER: I'm not sure.
<i> DISPATCHER:</i> <i> Is anyone injured?</i> CALLER: I think... (panting) I think some people are dead.
(electrical buzzing) (alarm continues) (gasping) Tell them to hurry.
